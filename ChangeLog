  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbx
    * Regenerated.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    + Refined: the behavior of ACTION clasue of PUSHBUTTON.
       If ACTION returns a name of a GET then it is brought to 
       focus. If NIL is returned, it takes usual course to next GET.
       Probably, this solves remaining issues pertaining to 
       validation per GET or per form.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
    % Demonstrates the ACTION clause usage.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbx
    * Regenerated.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: __hbqtRgbStringFromColorString( cToken, lExt ) -> cRgbFuncCall
    + Added: __hbqtCSSFromColorString( cColor ) -> cColorsCSS 

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    + Extended: HbQtAlert( <xMessage>, [<aOptions>], [<cColorNorm>], [<nDelay>], [<cTitle>] )
        <xMessage>     == String or Array of message lines.

        [<aOptions>]   == Standard Harbour Argument

        [<cColorNorm>] == Standard Harbour Argument

        [<nDelay>]     == Seconds. Will return the option-in-focus.
          QUESTION: should it return 0 ?

        [<cTitle>] == Title to be displayed on titlebar, "Alert!" is the default.

    + Implemented: focus rectangle to be positioned on option-in-focus.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    ! Used ned functions and deleted method call.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
    + Added arguments to HbQtAlert() call to demonstrate the usage.

2012-12-19 08:53 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    + Implemented: placing a focus rectangle around GET in focus.
       This eliminates the need of any hack applied to recognize 
       where the user is at any given point of execution.

    + Implemented: @ ... CHECKBOX now accepts TtFfYyNn keystrokes in      
       addition to SPACEBAR to toggle the state. TtYy will mark it 
       and FfNn will uncheck. SPACEBAR toggles the state.
       This facilitates CLIPPER like behavior and eliminates the need 
       of using mouse.

    ; With this current phase of GET system compatibility is over.
       If you have any issues or functionality refinements, please 
       speak. 

    ; NEXT: TBrowse() implementation.

    + Prepared: to be embedded with Qt Designer created .ui widgets.
       Hopefully by tomorrow a basic implementation will be in place.
       Many ideas and protocols are evolving. Idea is to have this 
       integrated with Harbour GET System isolated or/and with .ui
       widgets.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    % Adjusted to take effect sub-system changes.

  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbc
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbx
    + Added: hbqtwidgets library which will host the components based on 
       pure HbQt. This, the first, components is Harbour's GET sub-system 
       usable in HbQt with pure GUI widgets. HbQt GET System almost 
       simulates the Harbour GETs with <SAY>, <VALID>, <WHEN>, 
       <PICTURE>, <COLOR> clauses at the minimum required to port 
       console mode Clipper code to GUI. In addition provides the 
       extended VALIDation protocol. 

       In the coming days, Harbour's powerful GET system is scheduled 
       to be integrated with Qt Designer designed widgets. A working 
       prototype is in place but needs a bit more work to be committed.

  * qtcontribs.hbp
    + Added: hbqtwidget library.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    * Cleanup.

  * hbqt/tests/hbmk.hbm
    + Added: hbqtwidgets.hbc

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    - Removed: code specific to hbqtwidgets library.

  ; To use HbQt GET System you will need to link hbqtwidgets library 
      with your project. Add a line to your.hbp : hbqtwidgets.hbc.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    ! mainly code clean-up, removed redundancy.

2012-12-09 02:05 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    ! Small fix.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Many, many, many improvements.
       In nutshell, the engine is rewritten to overload Harbour's
       GET sub-system and encapsulate it in its entirety. All 
       GETs related functions are working, e.g., GetActive():varGet()/Put().

     + @ ... QSAY ... QGET ... is functional.
     + PageUp/Dn navigates to First and Last gets.
     ! VALID is not evaluated if WHEN could not been validated.
     + Array GETs are working.

     ; Please test and report differences.

2012-12-07 01:27 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Demonstrated: how a Clipper form can be executed in a scrollable
       widget. Resize the window and experience how scrolling is working.
       This way we can present much larger forms then a typical Clipper
       screen could offer. 

    + Implemented: "@E" and "@Snn" PICTURE functions.

2012-12-06 18:56 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: ROW/COL properties of GETs.

    + Implemented: @ <nRow>, <nCol> QSAY <exp> PICTURE <pic> COLOR <clr>.
       COLOR is not yet implemented, needs discussion.

    + Implemented: Clipper like form creation with @ SAY, @ GET commands
       given a parent window without any layout. 

    + Implemented: support of QFont to be applied to SAYs and GETS.
       This automatically sets the size and 

    ! Made: Clipper like form the startup display mode. Send "P" as 
       parameter to invoke OOP code screen.

    ; NOTE: we are almost near to design a GUI screen with Clipper code.
            QFont supplied to the form is not set on parent window. It is 
            applied only to SAYs and GETs. The rows are calculated on the 
            basis of QFont:height() and each row is separated by 6 pixels.

    ;       This seems, the whole protocol can be enhanced to a greater 
            horizon with a possibility to have multiple forms in one window.

2012-12-05 18:09 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: real-time validation indication in the form of 
       change in background-color of edit instance. The Clipper variable 
       is only updated if RETURN or TAB is pressed, just like Clipper.
    + Matured: numeric GET entry protocol. In some ways it is better 
       than Clipper's. PICTURE clause is completely supported.

    ; NOTE: with this basic implementation of Harbour GET System is 
            complete. Please test with your in-production code, if possible.
            If you find differences, please report. Also it will be 
            helpful if you supply some complex PICTURE clauses used 
            in your applications to be added to this demo code.

    ; OPINION: seems this class can be entirely ported to C++ as HBQGet.
               Should it remain as PRG class or be shifted to C++ ?

    ; NEXT: class/code to generate a data-aware form encapsulating
            @ <nRow>,<nCol> SAY <exp,...> GET <exp,...>.

       VALID is broken if value of a numeric GET is invalid and focus 
       is placed on another object with mouse-click and then returned 
       to numeric GET. I am at a loss to understand the behavior of 
       QValidator in this respect as why it receives :Intermediate
       return and then never set it back.

2012-12-03 19:02 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: GET Picture Templates in addition to Picture Functions.
    + Implemented: Numeric GET "+-." positioning, confirmation to pre
       and post decimal width. Currently based on variables original value.
       ;
       TODO: implementation of Picture Teplates.
    + Completed: Date GET implementation. Now it supports Set( _SET_DATEFORMAT ).
    + Implemented: mouse support as default. To switch off the mouse interaction
       call oEdit:mousable := .F. .
    + Implemented: changed background color to somewhat red of any GET if 
       if focus is taken away from it by mouse action and the value 
       contained in the edit buffer could not been validated with VALID 
       clause. This is a visual only part and actual VALID is performed
       only by keyboard navigation.
    + Added one more field "Telephone Number:" which facilitates the 
       verification of template part of picture.

    ; Please test extensively and report back if you see any issues with

                   QREAD

       This implementation demonstrates how Clipper code can be 
       re-used in GUI environment. The implementation demonstrate 
       both, OOP and COMMAND syntax usages. Execute validator.exe 
       with "p" as parameter to invoke COMMAND code.

       Presently suppoted PICTURE strings are "@!" for character 
       and "Y" for logicals. Others will come up next.

       COLOR clause supports Cliiper's standard 16 colors. It can be 
       passed as "W+/B",   "B",    "W+/BG*", i.e., foreground/background
       pair. Only one color will be applied to text color.

       Data binding is implemented via :dataLink( bBlock ) method.

       For COMMAND syntax, to fetch set/get block, Harbour's 
       GET system is used. Hope it can be exploited further.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Updated: to confirm to Clipper Get System with WHEN and VALIDS.
       The code hosts a small class inherited from QLineEdit which 
       controls the edit behavior of gets both per navigation and 
       input standards. ENTER and UP/DOWN arrows also behave 
       per Clipper standards. The implementation completely by-pass 
       mouse input, i.e., no edit is selectable with mouse click.
       This was required to implement WHEN and VALID.

       The class is still a work in progress. As I am feeling tired 
       and also it is almost morning, I need to sleep. In the meantime
       examine the code and post your views/opinions/suggestions/whatever.
       Also keep in mind to suggest where such classes, which simulate,
       Clipper behavior, should be hosted.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    % HBQValidator block returning QValidator:Intermediate if the supplied 
       text is empty. This is always the case when edit object is 
       presented for input the first time. Also it relieves the programmer
       to implement it on every GET manually.

2012-11-30 13:12 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    + Implemented: QValidator::Intermediate return value.
       HOW: If the validating function return NIL as sole return-value 
              OR
            NIL as third element of returned array;
            QValidator::Intermediate is returned back to QValidator::validate().

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbqt/qtgui/qth/QLineEdit.qth
    % Marked [*D=1*] for :setValidator().

  + hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.h
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.hbm
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.hbx
    + Added: HBQValidator() sub-class inheriting QValidator().
       This facilitates to simulate Harbour Get System's input behavior, 
       primarily in relation to picture clause at the minimum. But it 
       is much more then that. A clever use can put you under total 
       control what exactly you want the user to input.

       SYNTAX:  oEdit := QLineEdit( oWnd )
                oEdit:setValidator( HBQValidator( {|cText, nPos| DoValidation( cText, nPos ) } ) ) 

       RETURN VALUE OF VALIDATION BLOCK:
                It is important to understand the rationale of return 
                value of code-block supplied as only parameter to 
                HBQValidator which controls the behavior of validation.
                This can be one of the following:

                1. NIL     : will be treated as input is valid.
                2. .T.     : will be treated as input is valid.
                3. .F.     : will not allow the current character.
                4. String  : will replace the input string with returned string.
                5. Numeric : will relocate the editing cursor to this position.
                6. Array   : { cModifiedText|NIL, nCursorPos|NIL, lValid|NIL }
                             the elements corresponds to above #4, #5, #1;2;3

  + hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Added: a demonstration appln consuming HBQValidator() with 
       3 different constraints with many sub-variants which clearly 
       shows the power of this class. You can experiment further and 
       can add interesting combinations in this demo.

        any function from within single load. Note that each function, 
        if modified, has to be saved before loading another.
    + Implemented: logic to retain the blank sections also if present 
        in the function body. This facilitates to have exact same content,
        except for the modified one, in the saved file.

  ; TOBE VERIFIED: 
    1. some harbour/doc/en/.txt files have different order 
       of 2 keywords as:  COMPLIANCE FILES PLATFORMS whereas majority of 
       documents have COMPLIANCE PLATFORMS FILES. 
       should these be fixed all together or when some is modified ?

    2. contrib/hbct/doc/en/*.txt do not contain TEMPLATE section 
       in any of the files. All are functions only.
       These need to be addressed all at once.

  ; DONE: Add "Run time error" template entry.

  ; WORKING:
    1. Now function name holds the key if a function documentation will be 
         replaced or added to the .txt file being modified. This means, 
         changing the name of the function will add an entry with new name.
         The match is case insensitive, i.e., WvgCheckBox() will be equal to 
         WvgCHECKbox().

    2. All the other upper entries are retained as is if some exist, i.e. like
         copyright notices or SVN header.

    3. Has eliminated the keyword $FUNCNAME$ from entire repository and 
         is replaced by $NAME$.

  ; USABILITY: it is recommended that now you use HbIDE to build / edit
               Harbour documentation. The tool is ready to go. 

2012-11-10 23:40 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbide/docwriter.prg
  * hbide/harbourhelp.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
    + Implemented: HbIDE Documentation Writer updated to load/save 
       documentation from disk files with .txt extention. This will 
       facilitate the visual way to update Harbour documentation per
       Nanforum standards, which at present, is employed in Harbour 
       all-over.

    ; WORKING:
      Editing Existing Documentation:

        1. Click on "Load from .txt file" toolbar icon.
        2. If .txt contains many functions then a list will be presented 
             to select one.
        3. Make the necessary changes.
        4. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.
       
      Creating New Documentation:

        1. Click on "Clear Foem" toolbar icon. Necessary only if you worked 
             on some other function previously.
        2. Fill in the fields.
        3. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        4. FileSave dialog will be presented to obtain folder where to save.
             FileName will be auto-constructed from type and function name.
             You can keep it as is or change per your liking.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.
      
      Both ways SVN Id header will be placed on top of the documentation file.

    ; WHAT WE CAN LOOSE IF EXISTING DOCUMENTATION IS EDITED:  
        
        1. Copyright notices posted on top of the file.
        2. $COMPLIANCE$ is converted to $PLATFORMS$ and is only oneliner.
        3. If $COMPLIANCE$ and $PLATFORMS$ both are present then only 
             $COMPLIANCE$ is retained.
        4. Leading "*" will not be present
        5. may be more but I have observed above differences 
             while experimenting with harbour/doc/en/*.txt files.

    + Added: <Main Menu><Encoding> option.
       It displays the codepages in this notation: 
         Harbour Codepage Name : Unique Codepage ID => "RU866 : cp866"

    + Implemented: per source Harbour supported codepage.
       Now you can write sources supporting different code pages for 
       strings inside source text. Each edit instance can have its own 
       codepage which can be selected from <Encoding> main-menu option.
       HbIDE remembers codepage associated with a source. When selecting 
       a codepage from <Encoding> option, you will be prompted to set 
       it as "default". The <Default> codepage will be applied to any 
       new source brought to HbIDE for editing. 

    ; IMPORTANT : Please read
       1. Setup this current commit or release.
       2. DO NOT execute HbIDE.
       3. Open hbide.ini you are supplying to execute HbIDE.
       4. Change: CurrentCodec=_HarbourCodePageName_ => 
                  CurrentCodec=EN
       5. Execute HbIDE.
       6. Notice the statusbar of HbIDE where codepage entry should be 
            visible as "Enc: EN | EN".
       7. First part denotes codepage of this source, second part 
            default codepage.
       8. If you need to change the codepage of a source, make sure that 
            it has not been modified before the change, initiate change 
            from <Encoding> option, close HbIDE, do not save the source 
            when prompted, run HbIDE again. This action can be taken for 
            multiple source instances. Just REMEMBER that you have not 
            to save the source after changing the codepage.

    ; THANKS : Special thanks to Grzegorz and Maurizio for helping me 
               understand what is happening under the hood.

      Please make extensive tests. Regression is possible.

  + Applied patch by Francesco Perillo (as explained below), thank you.

  * qtcontribs.hbp 
    ! all not-essential Qt modules are remmed by default. 
      You need to remove the remark if you want them to be compiled. 
      Too much problems reported for aborted builds. In the future we may 
      add checks and skip modules missing include files, for the moment it 
      will be programmers responsability to un-rem them
    + added -hbcontainer so that the error line about nm is not shown

  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    ! added instpath to current harbour BIN path. This means that hbide 
      will be copied in the same directory where harbour executable is ! 
      This will work both for simple "make" and for "make install"
    ! modified output dir that is anyway replaced by instpath directive

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbp
    + added $hb_pkg_install.hbm
    ! changed path for lib creation

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbxbp.hbp file

  * hbqt/hbqt_common.hbm
    ! changed lib target directory
    + copied $hb_pkg_install.hbm content and modified to fit hbQt build method. 
      the standard hbm file uses lib name to create a subdir where to store its 
      files during install. This is ok for simple libraries like hbxbp, 
      where only one lib is created, while it is a problem for hbQT where several 
      libraries are created... otherwise we would get addons/hbqtcore addons/hbqtgui. 
      no way....  So the changes was just to set hbqt as target directory, 
      all the rest unmodified...

  * hbqt/hbqt.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbqt_common.hbm file

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Usual: last commit info.

  * hbide/actions.prg
    ! Fixed: "New" icon on the toolbar was not working due to spells.

  * hbide/sources.prg
    ! Fixed: adding a source through "New" menu or toolbar option was 
       asking for the file location twice.

  * hbxbp/filedialog.prg
    ! Changed: XbpFileDialog():saveAs() consuming QFileDialog's 
        static function instead of old-fashioned dialog. 
        This fixes the issue where default file name was not populated 
        in the filename field.

  + hbide/hbide_v.ch
    + Readded: the header containing latest revision number.
       This is done because otherwise HbIDE cannot be built by a 
       user who has not properly set QtContribs build environment,
       which, along other things, require subversion client installed
       on his machine. Mostly it will never be required for average user 
       but just in case...

       NOTE: this will always publish one revision less than the current 
             in HbIDE title-bar.

       are not in synch with HbQt folder locations.

2012-10-08 01:24 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbxbp/generic.prg

    ! Fixed: some wrong constants.
       Thanks Przemek for introducing duplicate case constants compile 
       time check which could detect these type of error, something 
       rare to debug otherwise.

2012-10-07 15:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: the version guard agaisnt which a class is compiled.
       Earlier every class was guarded against v4.5.
       Now class is guarded against minimum of v4.5 or defined for 
       a class in .qth in CLASS section. 
         <CLASS> 
         ...
         Version = 0x040n00 
         </CLASS>
 
       This empowers HbQt engine to add any class comes with new version 
       of Qt.

       entire set of actions spread across menus and toolbars. This 
       tiny toolbox can be called with Ctrl+M and appears right near 
       the editing cursor position. The interface to manage this toolbox
       is underway, which beside other things, will facilitate to 
       configure it visually as to which icons, at what position:row-col,
       should appear. The goal is to allow users to hide all toolbars from 
       applications window and call this toolbox whenever there is a need.
       A work-in-progress. But the toolbox is functional with Ctrl+M.

  * hbide/docviewgenerator.ui
    % Refined: the working of slider of tree and view widgets, reported 
      on users-list. The tree pane area was unable to be expanded on 
      the right and hence functions list contents were not visible 
      properly.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    % Optimization leading to proper object destruction on Qt level,
       in certain cases. This optimization has no visible impact, but 
       certainly improves memory consumption in applications which 
       have high rate of creation/destruction cycles.

    ! Fixed: the GPF og HbIDE on EXIT on MSVC and *nix systems discovered 
       by Przemek. On MSVC it is fixed, and nixes, I hope should have been 
       fixed too. Can someone confirm ?
