  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbide/main.prg
    + Opened: left-hand side "Projects Tree" docking widget if HbIDE is 
       started with "HBP" mode as - hbide.exe myproject.hbp

  * hbxbp/dbu.prg
    + Added: "Natural Order" prompt in deop-down list of "Indexes" in HbpDBU.
        Requested by Massimo.

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbp
    ! Fixed: to transfer binaries in Harbour's lib folder.
        This had given me a lot of hedaches, thanks GVS for the hint.

2012-11-11 11:48 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbide/actions.prg
    ! Log standing bug fix in "Recent Files/Projects". Thanks Grzegorz.

  * hbide/docwriter.prg
    ! Fixed: to eliminate most of the pitfalls as per previous commit.

  ; WORKING:
    1. Now function name holds the key if a function documentation will be 
         replaced or added to the .txt file being modified. This means, 
         changing the name of the function will add an entry with new name.
         The match is case insensitive, i.e., WvgCheckBox() will be equal to 
         WvgCHECKbox().

    2. All the other upper entries are retained as is if some exist, i.e. like
         copyright notices or SVN header.

    3. Has eliminated the keyword $FUNCNAME$ from entire repository and 
         is replaced by $NAME$.

  ; USABILITY: it is recommended that now you use HbIDE to build / edit
               Harbour documentation. The tool is ready to go. 

2012-11-10 23:40 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    ! Version bump.

  * hbide/docwriter.prg
  * hbide/harbourhelp.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
    + Implemented: HbIDE Documentation Writer updated to load/save 
       documentation from disk files with .txt extention. This will 
       facilitate the visual way to update Harbour documentation per
       Nanforum standards, which at present, is employed in Harbour 
       all-over.

    ; WORKING:
      Editing Existing Documentation:

        1. Click on "Load from .txt file" toolbar icon.
        2. If .txt contains many functions then a list will be presented 
             to select one.
        3. Make the necessary changes.
        4. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.
       
      Creating New Documentation:

        1. Click on "Clear Foem" toolbar icon. Necessary only if you worked 
             on some other function previously.
        2. Fill in the fields.
        3. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        4. FileSave dialog will be presented to obtain folder where to save.
             FileName will be auto-constructed from type and function name.
             You can keep it as is or change per your liking.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.
      
      Both ways SVN Id header will be placed on top of the documentation file.

    ; WHAT WE CAN LOOSE IF EXISTING DOCUMENTATION IS EDITED:  
        
        1. Copyright notices posted on top of the file.
        2. $COMPLIANCE$ is converted to $PLATFORMS$ and is only oneliner.
        3. If $COMPLIANCE$ and $PLATFORMS$ both are present then only 
             $COMPLIANCE$ is retained.
        4. Leading "*" will not be present
        5. may be more but I have observed above differences 
             while experimenting with harbour/doc/en/*.txt files.

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Usual: last commit info.

  + hbide/requests.ch
    + Added: header to REQUEST all codepages Harbour supports.
       Just in case...

  * hbide/actions.prg
  * hbide/docks.prg
  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/saveload.prg
  * hbide/sources.prg
    + Added: <Main Menu><Encoding> option.
       It displays the codepages in this notation: 
         Harbour Codepage Name : Unique Codepage ID => "RU866 : cp866"

    + Implemented: per source Harbour supported codepage.
       Now you can write sources supporting different code pages for 
       strings inside source text. Each edit instance can have its own 
       codepage which can be selected from <Encoding> main-menu option.
       HbIDE remembers codepage associated with a source. When selecting 
       a codepage from <Encoding> option, you will be prompted to set 
       it as "default". The <Default> codepage will be applied to any 
       new source brought to HbIDE for editing. 

    ; IMPORTANT : Please read
       1. Setup this current commit or release.
       2. DO NOT execute HbIDE.
       3. Open hbide.ini you are supplying to execute HbIDE.
       4. Change: CurrentCodec=_HarbourCodePageName_ => 
                  CurrentCodec=EN
       5. Execute HbIDE.
       6. Notice the statusbar of HbIDE where codepage entry should be 
            visible as "Enc: EN | EN".
       7. First part denotes codepage of this source, second part 
            default codepage.
       8. If you need to change the codepage of a source, make sure that 
            it has not been modified before the change, initiate change 
            from <Encoding> option, close HbIDE, do not save the source 
            when prompted, run HbIDE again. This action can be taken for 
            multiple source instances. Just REMEMBER that you have not 
            to save the source after changing the codepage.

    ; THANKS : Special thanks to Grzegorz and Maurizio for helping me 
               understand what is happening under the hood.

      Please make extensive tests. Regression is possible.
 
2012-10-24 14:31 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  + Applied patch by Francesco Perillo (as explained below), thank you.

  * qtcontribs.hbp 
    ! all not-essential Qt modules are remmed by default. 
      You need to remove the remark if you want them to be compiled. 
      Too much problems reported for aborted builds. In the future we may 
      add checks and skip modules missing include files, for the moment it 
      will be programmers responsability to un-rem them
    + added -hbcontainer so that the error line about nm is not shown

  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    ! added instpath to current harbour BIN path. This means that hbide 
      will be copied in the same directory where harbour executable is ! 
      This will work both for simple "make" and for "make install"
    ! modified output dir that is anyway replaced by instpath directive

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbp
    + added $hb_pkg_install.hbm
    ! changed path for lib creation

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbxbp.hbp file

  * hbqt/hbqt_common.hbm
    ! changed lib target directory
    + copied $hb_pkg_install.hbm content and modified to fit hbQt build method. 
      the standard hbm file uses lib name to create a subdir where to store its 
      files during install. This is ok for simple libraries like hbxbp, 
      where only one lib is created, while it is a problem for hbQT where several 
      libraries are created... otherwise we would get addons/hbqtcore addons/hbqtgui. 
      no way....  So the changes was just to set hbqt as target directory, 
      all the rest unmodified...

  * hbqt/hbqt.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbqt_common.hbm file

  * hbide/actions.prg
    ! Fixed: "New" icon on the toolbar was not working due to spells.

  * hbide/sources.prg
    ! Fixed: adding a source through "New" menu or toolbar option was 
       asking for the file location twice.

  * hbxbp/filedialog.prg
    ! Changed: XbpFileDialog():saveAs() consuming QFileDialog's 
        static function instead of old-fashioned dialog. 
        This fixes the issue where default file name was not populated 
        in the filename field.

  + hbide/hbide_v.ch
    + Readded: the header containing latest revision number.
       This is done because otherwise HbIDE cannot be built by a 
       user who has not properly set QtContribs build environment,
       which, along other things, require subversion client installed
       on his machine. Mostly it will never be required for average user 
       but just in case...

       NOTE: this will always publish one revision less than the current 
             in HbIDE title-bar.

    ! Fixed: some wrong constants.
       Thanks Przemek for introducing duplicate case constants compile 
       time check which could detect these type of error, something 
       rare to debug otherwise.

2012-10-07 15:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: the version guard agaisnt which a class is compiled.
       Earlier every class was guarded against v4.5.
       Now class is guarded against minimum of v4.5 or defined for 
       a class in .qth in CLASS section. 
         <CLASS> 
         ...
         Version = 0x040n00 
         </CLASS>
 
       This empowers HbQt engine to add any class comes with new version 
       of Qt.

    IMPLEMENTED: the objects having any signal connected to remain alive 
                 irrespective of the Harbour variable scope. Uptil now 
                 a :connect() to be functional, the variable holding the 
                 object had to remain in scope till the life of that 
                 connect's life-span. Now it is not needed. Below is 
                 the example ( hbqt/tests/qtrevamp.prg : snippet ):

                 STATIC FUNCTION BuildMenuBar( oWnd )
                    LOCAL oMenu1, oMenuBar

    % Optimizations.
    + Implemented: concept of manageable tool-box containing almost 
       entire set of actions spread across menus and toolbars. This 
       tiny toolbox can be called with Ctrl+M and appears right near 
       the editing cursor position. The interface to manage this toolbox
       is underway, which beside other things, will facilitate to 
       configure it visually as to which icons, at what position:row-col,
       should appear. The goal is to allow users to hide all toolbars from 
       applications window and call this toolbox whenever there is a need.
       A work-in-progress. But the toolbox is functional with Ctrl+M.

  * hbide/projectwizard.prg

    + Advanced: "New Project Wizard".

    % Refined: the working of slider of tree and view widgets, reported 
      on users-list. The tree pane area was unable to be expanded on 
      the right and hence functions list contents were not visible 
      properly.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    % Optimization leading to proper object destruction on Qt level,
       in certain cases. This optimization has no visible impact, but 
       certainly improves memory consumption in applications which 
       have high rate of creation/destruction cycles.
