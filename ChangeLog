  ; Presenting HbQtLogAnalyzer() - A Tool to Analyze Logs in a Variety of Ways

    ; The Background:
       At Curacao, a shade less than 1000 users/terminals remains on for the 
       best part of the day, spreading accross different cities and locations,
       all accessing the same business application. Usually users do not report 
       if any error is generated. For days it goes on unnoticed until reported 
       or looked into error logs regularly. Even looking into error logs does 
       not yield accurate state of things. 

       This motivated me to develop a tool, from Harbour's point-of-view specifically,
       which could provide enough insite into the state of errors, and from 
       different angels. Initially I started with our standatd errorlog, 
       but soon realized that with some little more effort it can be a generic 
       tool. That little effort resulted in HbQtLogAnalyzer() class, which to my 
       amazement, could parse all other logs generated in our organization. And 
       I am sure that this tool will be good for any type of log generated 
       from any language, machine, or server.

    : How to implement in your application:

       WITH OBJECT oAnalyzer := HbQtLogAnalyzer():new( oParent ):create()
          :loadConfiguration( hb_DirBase() + "errors.hlg" )
          :loadLog( hb_DirBase() + "errors12.16" )
       ENDWITH 
       // Provide a container to LogAnalyzer widget
       //
       oParent:layout():addWidget( oAnalyzer:widget() )
      
    : The Interface:
       LEFT Pane: 
        TreeView containing all the entries in the log chronologically. 
        Each entry is serialized and depicted with the <Description> field 
        defined in the log definition. The child node of each entry contains 
        all other fields defined in the definition. 

       RIGHT Pane: 
        A context sensitive toolbar at the top - TOP-TOOLBAR:
        .
        ToolButton - Paste selection on clipboard.
         This button is active when ANALYSIS tab is in focus. 
         Copies the contents of selected fields and rows on clipboard.

        ToolButton - Save selection as .csv file.
         This button is active when ANALYSIS tab is in focus. 
         Opens a FileSave dialog to fetch the .csv filename, then
         Saves the contents of selected fields and rows in a provided .csv file.

        A Tab Widget at the bottom containing following tabs:
        .
        ANALYSIS  : Contains a table widget containing field values of log entries.
        SUMMARIES : Contains a tree-view at the top depicting summaries of entries 
                    grouped by fields defined to be analyzed.
        CONFIGURE : An interface to define definition files for each type of 
                    log you intend to analyze. A very intuitive and powerful   
                    definition writer.

        ( SEEMS the textual help as above will not be useful, so I will post on 
          QtContribs site at source-forge some detailed GUI aided pages which will 
          demonstrate how to use this tool to the best of your advantage. 
		  
		  Infact, I wanted to present this tool to you as a new year gift for 2017
		  but on 31st I fell sick and it took me a while to recover. So, please 
		  accept it as originally intended. )

  * hbqtwidgets/scripts.prg

      FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf GROUP BY age,state ORDER BY age-desc,state WHERE age > 66

  * hbqtwidgets/scripts.prg
    % Changed : SQL parser from procedural to class code.

    + Array browser window adjusts to number of columns in the record upto 
       maximum columns which can be accomodated on the screen.

    + Implemented: SQL aggregate functions:
       a) Count( * )
       b) Min( cNumFieldName *|+|-|/ cSecondNumField *|+|-|/ cThirdNumField )
       c) Max( cNumFieldName *|+|-|/ cSecondNumField *|+|-|/ cThirdNumField )
       d) Avg( cNumFieldName *|+|-|/ cSecondNumField *|+|-|/ cThirdNumField )
       e) Sum( cNumFieldName *|+|-|/ cSecondNumField *|+|-|/ cThirdNumField )
 
    + Implemented: SQL string functions:
       a) SubStr( cCharFieldName, nFrom [, nCount ] )
       b) Left( cCharFieldName, nCount )
       c) Right( cCharFieldName, nCount )
       d) Upper( cCharFieldName )
       e) Lower( cCharFieldName )

    + Implemented: A general purpose field to club multiple numeric columns.
       It is like SUM() function but is not an aggregate function. Syntax is:
       a) Func( salary * age )

        
    ; WARNING: no parenthesis inside the function body.
    ; Title of the column representing above functions is constructed 
       automatically. Still, I am at a loss how to implement AS clause.
       [ Preprocessor Limitation ].

    ; Example calls:
       SELECT * FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ORDER BY age WHERE age>=90

       SELECT first,last,age,state,zip,sum(age * age),count(*) ;
       FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ORDER BY age-desc,state WHERE age>66

       SELECT age,state,Func(age*salary),Right(state,1),Sum(salary),Min(salary),Max(salary),Avg(salary),Count(*) ;
       FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf GROUP BY age,state ORDER BY age-desc,state WHERE age > 66

2016-12-06 16:27 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r442)
  * hbqtwidgets/scripts.prg
    + Implemented LIKE operator in WHERE clause.
      SELECT first,last,age,state,zip ;
        FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ;
        ORDER BY age-desc,state ;
        WHERE last LIKE 'Vedal%'

      OR

      SELECT first,last,age,state,zip ;
        FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ;
        ORDER BY age-desc,state ;
        WHERE last LIKE 'Vedal'

      If "%" is not postfixed with search string then the behavior will 
      be exactly the same as "=" opertaor.

      "=" operator matches the exact string.
      "LIKE" without "%" will match the exact string.
      "LIKE" with "%" will match the first characters of the string.

    + Implemented local resizable array browser to display the result set.
       instead of calling Browse() which reduces the overhead to save 
       results in a table and then display. INTO clause is still respected,
       though.

    - Removed: <-include> line edit. 

    + Added: <-include> combo-box where multiple paths can be added and 
       managed as a drop-down list.

       How to Add   : Just type in the path in combo's edit field and 
                      press ENTER.
       How to Delete: Select the desired entry so that you can see it 
                      in the combo's edit field, right-click, select 
                      <Delete> from the context menu.

       In single lineEdit control it was a mess to organize the paths.

    + The .hsv (Harbour Scripts View) filename is dispalyed on the 
       header of scripts tree. While saving and opening a new .hsv 
       the file open dialog now respects this path for .hsv files.

    + The path to the root of HbDBU is passed as an -i(nclude) directive 
       when a script is run.
    + If the script is a saved disk file, then, this path is also sent 
       as an -i(nclude) directive. Moreover, for console mode run, 
       the script is run while thread stays in this path.

    + Added: FUNCTION __hbqtExecSelect( cFields, cFrom, cWhere, cOrder, cInto ) 
       which is activated with a statement like:

       SELECT first,last,age,state FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ;
       ORDER BY age-desc,state WHERE age>60

       #command SELECT <fld,...> FROM <from> ;
                  [INTO <into>] ;
                  [ORDER BY <order,...>] ;
                  [WHERE <*whr*>] ;
              => ;
        __hbqtExecSelect( #<fld>, <"from">, #<whr>, #<order>, <"into"> )

       preprocessor directive is sent with the script buffer automatically.

     ; Yes, you read it right. HbQtScripts now implement a sub-set of 
        SQL SELECT statement which is translated to database commands and 
        result is displayed via Browse(). Let us understand the difference
        in true SQL statement components vs HbQt.
         
        SELECT    * | comma sapartaed list of valid field names - no UDFs yet.

        FROM      fully qualified table name with path and extention. By default 
                  DBFCDX driver is used, but to use another driver prefix the 
                  table name with driver and "|", like:
                        dbfcdx|c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf
                  This must be the 2nd component of the statement.

        INTO      fully qualified table name with path and extention where 
                  results will be deposited. DBFCDX is used for this purpose.

        ORDER BY  a comma separated list of field names contained in the result
                  set. Keyword "-desc" can be post-fixed with a fieldname to 
                  present in descending order. In example statement as above 
                  it is represented as - age-desc,state - where the whole result 
                  is sorted descending on age first, then within each age group
                  state is sorted ascending.

        WHERE     This must be the last component of the statement.
                  The only operator supported for multiple conditions is 
                  "AND" only, like: age > 90 and last = 'Thomas'.
                  The supported operators within a single condition are 
                  >=, <=, !=, <>, =, <, >. 

                  A condition has 3 components
                  //
                  1. FieldName - must be present in the table
                  2. Operator  - one of the >=, <=, !=, <>, =, <, >
                  3. Value     - string 'Thomas', numeric 90.0, date '2016-12-02'

                  a '=' condition is looked for if any index starting with its 
                  FieldName is available or not. If available, then index order 
                  is set to it and seek is performed with Value part which 
                  greately enhances the speed.

    ; You can test it by simply placing the above SQL statement in a function 
      and just run it in console mode, assuming that test.dbf actually resides
      where it is pointed to.

      FUNCTION __test()

         SELECT first,last,age,state FROM c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf ;
         ORDER BY age-desc,state WHERE age>60

         RETURN NIL

      oEditor then have almost everything a HbIDE contained editor has, viz., 
      syntax-hilighting, code formatting, cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, column 
      copy and paste, a very unique context toolbar which can be placed anywhere
      inside the editing window, horizontally or verically, and can be called 
      anytime anywhere with right-click. In a nutshell, this editor can serve 
      many of programmers needs. Note that it does not implement traditional 
      toolbars as such ( except for the right-click context toolbar ).
      All actions are carried by keyboard. 

      Actions available with keyboard:

      Ctrl_A    Select All
      Ctrl_C    Copy Selection
      Ctrl_V    Paste Selection 
      Ctrl_X    Copy Selection and Cut
      Ctrl_Z    Undo
      Ctrl_R    Redo
      Ctrl_F    Ask for serach string and find it - from current cursor position
      Ctrl_N    Continue search of last find downward
      Alt_N     Continue search of last find upward
      Ctrl_G    Ask for line number to jump at
      Ctrl_D    Duplicate current line
      Ctrl_Del  Delete current line 
      Ctrl_Up   Move current line one line up
      Ctrl_Down Moce current line one line down.
      Ctrl_P    Print preview
      Ctrl_L    Jump to last editing position

      Actions available in right-click context toolbar:
               
      1         Change selection mode - stream to column or vice versa
      2         Convert selection to upper case
      3         Convert selection to lower case
      4         Convert selection to invert case
      5         Comment out block
      6         Comment out stream
      7         Indent selection to the right
      8         Indent selection to the left
      9         Convert single quotes to double
      10        Convert double quotes to single
      11        Stringify selection
      12        Align column selection to...
      13        Toggle toolbar orintation
      14        Hide toolbar - bring it back with right-click

      Context toolbar is opened exactly at location you right-click in the 
      editor. The location can be changed just by right-clicking anywhere
      giving you the flexibility to hook it at least disturbing corner. 
      Once displayed, it stays there until you hide it with right-most 
      "X" icon.

  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
    % Minor.

  * hbqtwidgets/toolbar.prg
    + Restructured and enhanced HbQtToolbar class.

  * hbqtwidgets/misc.prg
    + Added Functions to create proprietory event loop for any top level widget.

      HbQtExit( cUnique, lExit, lDelete )
      HbQtExec( cUnique )
      //
         cUnique := __hbqtUniqueString( oWnd:objectName() )
         oWnd:connect( QEvent_Close, {|| HbQtExit( cUnique ) } )
         ...
         ...
         oWnd:show()
         HbQtExec( cUnique )
         oWnd:setParent( QWidget() )
         oWnd := nil 
         RETURN 
      //
      __hbqtUniqueString( cBaseStr )
      __hbqtTreeFindNode( oNode, cText )
      __hbqtTreeCollapseAll( oNode, lDirectChildrenOnly )
      __hbqtTreeExpandAll( oNode, lDirectChildrenOnly )
      __hbqtExecPopup( aOptions, oPoint )

      Please look for the implementation in scripts.prg.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + HbQtBrowseDB( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, hConfig )

      A GUI replacement for Clipper Browse() function. The function creates
      a separate window displaying the browser and deploys its own even loop.
      This function consumes HbQtExit()/HbQtExec() functions and demonstrates
      its powerful usage. You can call this function for many tables 
      simultaneously.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    % Minor.

  + hbqtwidgets/hilighter.prg
    + Added class HbQtHilighter()
       Pulled from HbIDE but without user interface. Implements only default 
       themes, viz., Bare Minimum, City Lights, Sand Storm, Pritpal's Favourite
       Classical, Evening Glamour.

  + hbqtwidgets/scripts.ui
  + hbqtwidgets/scripts.prg
    + Added: class HbQtScripts() - An interface to create, organize, manage 
      and run Harbour scripts. The component is implemnted to be callable 
      within an applcation via a single line call.

      oScripts := HbQtScripts():new():create( oParent )

      If oParent == nil then a top-level widget is presented. 
      If oParent is passed then make sure that no layout is applied to it.
      Alternatively you can provide a container yourself, like,
      
      oMainWindow:setCentralWidget( oScripts:widget() )
      OR
      oStackedWidget:addWidget( oScripts:widget() )
      OR 
      oLayout:addWidget( oScripts:widget() )
      

      The interface is divided into four sections. 

      Top    - A slim layout containing following elements:

        1  Name of the script file on disk - "new..." if none is loaded
        2  CheckBox for compiler switch -w3 - default checked 
        3  CheckBox for compiler switch -es2 - default checked
        4  LineEdit to provide other compiler switches; prefixed by "-" 
           and separated by space.
        5  LineEdit to provide include paths; a space separated list of 
           paths but without "-i" prefix. Run component adds "-i" in front 
           of each path.

      Left   - A tree widget to manage scripts. Bottom of tree widget contains 
               actions to manage the tree, viz., expand/collapse all/soft. 
               Tree widget also implements context menu with right-click.

      Right  - A fully loaded source editor - HbQtEditor(). Source contained
               in the editor is RUN as script. Please read above various 
               actions available in the editor.

      Middle - A thin, vertical toolbar containing following actions:

        1  Open [close] Left Pane   
            Can be clicked to close or open left pane.

        2  Load Script  
            Presents a file-open dialog. When invoked first time, navigation 
            points to executable's root folder. All subsequent openings, either 
            to open or save files remember and navigate to last folder.
            Scripts of type .prg or .hb can be opened. An entry into left-pane
            Scripts tree is recorded in the "Default" section or group which 
            you can arrange to your liking by dragging and dropping in 
            required section. The contents of the script file are loaded in 
            right-pane HbQtEditor. You are free to edit / run / and save.

        3  New Script
            Clears the contents of HbQtEditor and a FUNCTION __test() is 
            deposited in the editor. Obiviously name of the buffer is displayed 
            as "new..." on the top-left element. You are free to 
            edit / run / and save ( with a valid name ).

        4  Save Scripts
            Presents a Save File dialog if it is a "new..." script. Otherwise 
            saves the script to already loaded name just like you would press
            Ctrl_S in the editor.

        5  Run Console Scripts
            Script engine is divided into two modes, console and GUI. Console 
            mode is executed in a threaded environment and hence is the safest. 
            A WVG console is fired on Windows and TRM on *nixes.            

        6  Run GUI Scripts
            This is a tricky part as HbQt cannot be executed in threaded mode.
            You would need to respect certain constructs as are employed in 
            hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse/HbQtBrowseDB() function. Mainly the whole 
            point involves application's and local event loop. Also you 
            can run plain vanilla scripts - no .ui integration yet. So 
            somewhat it is a limited implementation. Many of the 
            hbqtwidgets/tests/*.prg are working though, with some changes, 
            about to be committed next.

        7  Add Scripts Group
            Offers an input dialog to provide a Group name which will be added 
            as a top level node in the left-pane scripts tree. Then you are free 
            to organize it whereever you want.

        8  Restore Scripts View
            Restrores the entire environment of HbQtScripts from a 
            .hsv ( Harbour's Scripts View ) which has been saved via next action.
            Opens a File Open dialog to select a scripts. Read below what it 
            contains. When a new environment is loaded, all elements are 
            refreshed, current HbQtEditor contents are cleared, and a "new..."
            buffer is restored.

        9  Save Scripts View
            Saves the entire environment of HbQtScripts contents which include:
             a) Compiler switches
             b) Include paths
             c) The entire contents of Scripts Tree
             The environment is saved as a .hsv file in JSON format.

    + Added: Scripts top-toolbar icon.
    % Rearranged top-toolbar icons and few changed. 
    + Added HbQtScripts. A productivity tool for programmers. A test suit 
       for HbQt developers, especially who have started to look into GUI 
       world. Please read above for the details.

  * hbdbu/dbu.ui
  * hbdbu/hbdbu.hbp
    + Added: -mt switch required for console mode scripting to be flawless.
    + Added: hbnf, hbxbp, gtqtc.hbc. and many other contrib libs.

  ; HbDBU, now onwards, can be used to test your code piece-by-piece. It 
    will be uploaded to SVN in a couple of hours, as a statically linked, 
    stand-alone application, bundelling entire Harbour core, many contribs, 
    QtCore, QtGui and statically linked OpenSSL. 

    For beginners, either on HbQt or core Harbour, this tool can prove to
    be very productive, believe me, and give it a shot.

    Enjoy !

       The module is valid for Unix distros and hence it is 
       not added to the default builds. You have to add it 
       in QtContribs-N.hbp manually. All classes are compiled 
       without errors ( except for a hack I had to deploy 
       in Qt's QDBusConnect.h header )( from Windows compilation
       perspective only ). So hope that these will compile 
       on unix systems without problems.

    + Added following features in HbDBU:
      1 Tables TreeView - Added 4 icons on the top of left-pane.
         a. Collapse Soft - Collapses all "Driver" nodes.
         b. Collapse All - Collapses "Paths" nodes in addition to "Driver" nodes
         c. Expand Soft - Expands only "Driver" nodes.
         d. Expand All - Expands "paths" nodes as well.

      2 By default all nodes of tables tree are shown expanded when invoked.

      3 Right-clicking on "path" node will open FileOpen dialog with all 
         the .dbfs present in the folder. A feature request by Massimo.

    % <Save Env> button on the top-toolbar now saves settings in 
       user-defined *.dbu files. Before the settings were saved in file 
       which was used to invoke HbDBU.

    + <Rest Env> has undergone a fundamental change. This now invokes 
       another copy of HbDBU with environment picked from selected file.
       This way you can have multiple HbDBU's on screen with different 
       settings. This is a productivity feature. Before, the selected environment
       was merged with the current one.

    + Added <Online> icon on the top-toolbar which opens up the Windows only 
       interface which implements "shell.explorer.2" activex via 
       GtWVG class WvgActiveX(). The interface shows up a Harbour help 
       links on the left pane and web-browser on the right. By default 
       link for HbDBU ( http://qtcontribs.sourceforge.net ) is activated.
       The complete help for HbDBU is scheduled for next few days. Daily 
       I will be updating the site. Keep on visiting as needed.
       Also links of Harbour/Clipper/Clipper Tools ( recently revamped 
       by Viktor ) are also included. Allow scripts to run in IE for 
       flawless experience.

       This feature, in my opinion, comes handy for developers. I resorted to 
       GtWVG because Qt has discontinued QtWebkit and QWebView implementation 
       is well beyond our scope.

     + Implemented single HbDBU instance (Server) to accept multiple .dbf(s) 
        when a .dbf is double-clicked in the explorer, and extention .dbf has 
        been assigned to application HbDBU. Before, every invocation was opening 
        a separate copy of HbDBU. Class QSharedMemory() has been used to 
        implement this feature. Examine dbu.prg for details.

    ! Fixed: to be usable WITHOUT cppmm. Dynamic as well as Static builds.

  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    + Introduced Q_NULLPTR macro instead of NULL.
       This macro is backward compatible with Qt 4.x as well but this commit 
       has it on for Qt 5.7+ versions.

  * hbqt/qtcharts/hbqtcharts.hbx
    % Missing prototypes.

    % Few debugging change plus introducing Q_NULLPTR.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_destroyer.cpp
    % Introduced VM protection.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_pointer.cpp
    + Added: commented-out plugins for QtMultimedia needed for static builds.

  * hbqt/hbqt_common.hbc
    - Changed not to use hbcppmm implementation.
       Now Qt's own overloads are requested instead.
       The protocol is function for both Dynamic and Static linking.

    % Fixed to exit HbIDE promptly. Only modified source tabs are initiated.

    % Changed: Find & Replace dialog behavior - Whenever CTRL+F is used,
       the radio button <EntireFile> is checked. It means first time 
       search is initiated from begining of file.

    % Initiate QToolButton() with a parent to avoid unwanted gpf on exits.

  * qtcontribs57.hbp
    - Removed QtDesigner module.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version Bump.

  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/editor.prg
    % Changed behavior of main-toolbar icon "Print".
     Now, if some text is found selected in the source is sent to the 
     print preview instead of entire source. This is a two-phase 
     implementation: 
     1. A new editor window is opened with selected text inside.
     2. Print Preview is called automatically for the contents of such window.
     Editor window opened stays on top of the editor window whcih you need 
     to close explicitly. Until closed you can agian call Print Preview 
     by pressing Ctrl+P.

     A feature request by Massimo.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version Bump.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    ! Fixed: Navigation of QGETs with Tab/Sh+Tab key with validations.
     Note that navigation with Tab keys will not work if Gets are 
     initiated directly via class - like: oGet := HbQtGet():new().
     STATIC FUNCTION OOPLayout( oMain ) of validator.prg is one such 
     example. In all other cases, tab behaves exactly like RETURN.

  * hbide/actions.prg
    % Commented out IdeREPORTS icon and menu entry - Pointed by Massimo.

  * hbide/docks.prg
    + Added QProgressBar as one of the components of HbIDE's statusbar.

  * hbide/findreplace.prg
    % Changed the behavior of search starting from current cursor position 
     instead of from begining of file, if something was typed in the search 
     test edit line. 

    - Removed "Not Found" dialog if a serach string could not been found 
       via CTRL+F. Instead, not found string is displayed in 
       "Find:" statusbar panel, in bold, red, strike-out format.

  * hbide/main.prg
    + Added DATA member - oProgBar.

  * hbide/object.prg
    + Made oProBar accessible throught-out HbIDE classes.

  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented to show up the progessbar in statusbar when linking 
     or compilation is in progress.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_pointer.cpp
    ! Fixed: correct plugin names for static linking.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqtcore.hbc
    + Readied for static linking.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_errorsys.prg
    % Implemented patch provided by Luigi - not tested. Please report.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_init.cpp
    + Added __HBQTLIBRARYPATH() call before QApplication() is initiated.
     Somehow it went missing in some commit.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.ch

  + qtcontribs4.hbp
    + Added new Qt 4.x relevant Harbour project file.

    ; Brought back Qt 4.x compatibility for QtCore, QtGui and QtNetwork modules.
      NOTES:  1. Set environment HB_QT_MAJOR_VER=4.
              2. Set environment HB_USER_PRGFLAGS=-d__HB_QT_MAJOR_VER_4__
              3. Set environment variable HB_BUILD_NAME=-486 (where -486 == QtVer)

              This is the .bat used to compile for any version of Qt:

              @ECHO OFF

              SET HB_QT_MAJOR_VER=4
              SET HB_USER_PRGFLAGS=-d__HB_QT_MAJOR_VER_4__
              SET HB_BUILD_NAME=-486

              SET QT_PATH=C:\Qt486
              SET GW_PATH=C:\Qt550\Tools\mingw492_32

              SET PATH=D:\harbour\bin\win\mingw%HB_BUILD_NAME%;%GW_PATH%\bin;%QT_PATH%\bin;%PATH%

              SET HB_BUILD_CONTRIB_DYN=no
              SET HB_TR_SYSOUT=yes

              :__eof__  Add your build relevant other settings

              Convert above to Linux Script syntax.

      Now onwards compatibility for Qt 4.x will be maintain for base 3 modules.
      HbIDE, HbDBU, and many tests in HbQt and HbQtWidgets are running 
      normally. HbIDE sometimes throughs exception at exit. Every other 
      test app works flawlessly.

    Initial commit of Harbour engine for QML manipulation.

    QML is the next-generation offering by Qt which facilitates to develop 
    modern-looking, javaScript based applications. QML is also the core 
    language adopted by Ubuntu mobile plaforms and its concept of 
    one-os-fit-all-devices shift. So seems QML is set to become the 
    protocol of choice for so many applications.

    Harbour's implementation of Qt, i.e. HbQt, is essentially a widget 
    based implementation. It took me a while to turn to QML because 
    of the necessity to have barcode reading inside my mobile offerings.
    I remained reluctant to give QML a try for a long time because of the 
    complexity how Signal/Slot mechanism is implemented in Harbour.
    But when I took initiative, I found that it is simpler than my fear.
    Bottom line is : we can start using QML to some extent alsong-with 
    and within our existing widget based apps.

    CLASS HbQtQmlBridge() provides the building blocks to stream-line 
    the complexity of signal/slots, set/get properties, execute methods, etc.
    
       CLASS HbQtQmlBridge()

       METHOD init( oParent )
       METHOD create( oParent )

       METHOD setQml( cQml )                                -> lSuccess
       METHOD show()                                        -> NIL
       METHOD setProperty( cProperty, xValue )              -> lSuccess
       METHOD setChildProperty( cChild, cProperty, xValue ) -> lSuccess
       METHOD getProperty( cProperty )                      -> oQVariant | NIL
       METHOD getChildProperty( cChild, cProperty )         -> oQVariant | NIL
       METHOD invokeMethod( cMethod, ... )                  -> oQVariant | NIL
       METHOD connect( cSignal, bBlock )                    -> lSuccess
       METHOD connectChild( cChild, cSignal, bBlock )       -> lSuccess

       :create() only initiates a QQuickWidget(), set some of its 
         properties, connects it to error handeling slots and 
         lays it in a best-judged layout on its parent.

       :setQml( cQml ) is where all the action happens.
          This is the only place where we could know if a QML 
          document has been loaded or not. All subsequest operations 
          are executable only if we succeed here. Be noted that QML 
          engine is a scripting engine and is based on JavaScript 
          heavily.

    Lets disect CLASS HbQtBarcodeReader() and BarcodeReader.qml in 
    relevant context only. HbQtBarcodeReader() is developed to provide 
    one-line calling methodology in mind and has many other constructs
    you are already familiar with.

    METHOD HbQtBarcodeReader:create( oParent )    
       ...
       ...
       // register C++ classes in order to access them inside QML
       // immediately before those are about to be Used
       //
       HBQAbstractVideoSurface():registerQmlTypes()
       QZXing():registerQmlTypes()

      ::oQmlBridge := HbQtQmlBridge():new():create( ::oQmlContainerWidget )

      // provide the QML document location needed
      //
      IF ::oQmlBridge:setQml( "qrc:/hbqtqml/resources/qml/BarcodeReader.qml" )
         ::stopCamera()

         #ifndef __ANDROID__
            // because QVideoProbe() is only available for Android
            // we need render the frame ourselves, so this connection
            //
            ::oQmlBridge:connectChild( "videosurface", "imageAvailable(QImage)", {| oImage | ::dispImage( oImage ) } )
         #endif
         // we could have connected the "qzxing" child also for the same effect
         // but we decided to receive signal via QML document as it implements 
         // more constructs.
         //
         ::oQmlBridge:connect( "tagFound(QString)", {| cTag | ::manageBarcodeFound( cTag ) } )

         __hbqtAppRefresh()
      ENDIF
      ...
      ...
      RETURN self   

   
    BarcodeReader.qml [ only relevant parts ]:
    =========================================

    Rectangle {
        id         : cameraUI
        objectName : "camerainterface"     // name to access the object
                                           // as this is the root object

        }
        function stopScanning() {
           stopScanningFrames = true;

                                           // exploited via :connect()
        }
    
        VideoOutput {
            id               : viewfinder
            objectName       : "viewfinder"
            source           : Qt.platform.os == "android" ? camera : myVideoSurface
        }
    
        QZXing{
            id         : decoder
            objectName : "qzxing"
            onTagFound : {
                if( ! cameraUI.stopScanningFrames )
                {
                    cameraUI.stopScanningFrames = true;
                    playSoundCameraFlash.play();
                    cameraUI.tagFound( tag ); // emit the signal which we :connect()ed
                }
            }
        }
    
        HBQAbstractVideoSurface{
            id         : myVideoSurface
            objectName : "videosurface"   // will connect via :connectChild()
        }
    
        SoundEffect {
            id      : playSoundCameraFlash
            source  : "qrc:/hbqtqml/resources/wav/barcode-beep.wav"
        }
    }
    
    A convinient function, one-liner, can be fired to scan a barcode as:
    __hbqtActivateBarcodeReader( {|cBarcode| LetMePushIntoField( cBarcode ) } )

    I hope this class will flourish with passage of time as we will gain 
    more experience into QML and allied technology. I am impressed with 
    results and plan to share with you whatever meaningful I could muster.

    Enjoy and stay tuned!

  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    % Changed: the behavior of opening "Output Console".
       In case of any errors in project building Output Console is opened.
       At all other times no action is taken. It means if console is 
       already opened or kept opened after an error, it will remain 
       visible. A request by Daniel Du Pre.

    This commit is a sum total of many enhancements and new features mainly 
    targetting mobile platforms. Notably, HbQtBrowser has undergone tons of 
    improvements along-side HbQt Get System. HbQtBrowse now implements modeless 
    cell editing taking use of HbQtSilverLight object. This is specially useful
    for mobile apps where modal event loops are not handelled well.
    Now all of the HbQtWidget objects are desktop + mobile compliant.

       A greately improved parser which fixes many left-overs and other issues.
       Tested on HbIDE, HbDBU, many tests and my applications. It is 
       backwardly compatible but still needs to be improved upon 
       signal/slots, mostly, by switching on/off by a define.

       Please give a big hand to Francek. I personally pay a big thank-you.

       The reason to have these binaries in the SVN is that not everybody 
       has the expertise to build them on their systems because of many 
       depenendancies must be installed on the machine. In the past I 
       struggled to obtain the static libraries without success. I thank 
       Przemek for many pointers to this direction.

    + Redesigned: editing instance "SPLIT" protocol.
       Splitting an editing instance can be configured in two ways:
        HORIZONTAL Prime [ Default ]
          or
        VERTICAL Prime [ via <Setup><HbIDE Setup><General><Editing Area>

  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: to use stdout and/or stderr while catching result of 
       external process executed to detect the Qt version.
       
  * hbqt/qtcore/qth/QByteArray.qth
    % Changed: const char * constData()/data() returns data in proper length 
       by changing hb_retc(...) to hb_retclen(..., p->size()).

  * hbqt/qtcore/qth/QMimeData.qth
    % Changed: ( an HbQt Extention ) 
       QVariant imageData () const 
          =>
       QImage imageData () const
       It is always tricky to manage all types in QVariant what Qt provides.
       Also as the method name implies, one expects that it will return the 
       immage associated with QMimeData. And hence this simplification.

    @Ryszard Glab
       Other big stopper was pasting images from the clipboard. Current code 
       stores QImage in QVariant variable however QVariant has no method to convert 
       it to QImage. According to the Qt documentation the only solution is casting 
       at C++ level.  

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqabstractitemmodel.cpp
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqabstractitemmodel.h
    + Added: bool setData ( const QModelIndex & index, const QVariant & value, int role = Qt::EditRole );
       It is a handy mechanism to write back the values of a field just as 
       those are retrieved via getData method.

    @Ryszard Glab
       The really big problem with current hbqt code is lack of in-place editing 
       features of QTableView. Althought QTableView can edit cells using standard 
       build-in delegates (it work if you return Flags with Qt_ItemIsEditable and 
       use Qt_EditRole to get value from cell) however there is no possibility to 
       get back edited value from the delegate editor. Please consider the 
       following patch to extend current code to return the edited value to 
       codeblock used in hb_qabstractitemmodel - it requires the the codeblock have 
       to accept additional fifth parameter.

  ; The above patch is submitted by Ryszard Glab, a big thank you.
     For those who are new to Harbour and HbQt - an introduction to Ryszard Glab.
     Ryszard is one of the pioneers in maturing Harbour since its birth until 2008.
     Below is his last commit in Harbour:
        2008-02-02 23:40 UTC+0100 Ryszard Glab (harbour//rglab.pl)
     Till date he is remembered for his in-depth knowledge about programming 
     concepts and specifically Harbour. He is finishing a big project 
     heavily based on HbQt. This patch highlights the state of HbQt to 
     the effect that now we are production ready.

     I have requested him if he could provide few screen-shots of HbQt based 
     application with short description about its end-usage. That will certainly 
     put HbQt on some higher plane.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqgraphicsscene.cpp
    % Changed HBQGraphicsScene's grid ruler marking text in ( value / 100 ).

  * hbqtwidgets/visualitems.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/visualizer.prg
    % Modified to scale pixmaps only once per type of image and scene scale.
    + Added another toolbar icon to reach anywhere on the scene but preserving
       the zoom level before activation. 
         1. Zoom to the desired level.
         2. Click on the "Zoom Locate" icon.
         3. Scene will turn to fit-in-view mode.
         4. Double-click on the derired area of the scene.
         5. Scene will zoom to previous scale with clicked area anchored in center.

       The debug string build from list of parameters passed, CNLD types,
       is shown as Window's Titlebar retrieved by __hbqtAppWidget().
       This is very handy mechanism to debug something on the fly.

  ; DISCLAIMER: I have no interest in QScintilla by now. I wrote these 
          wrappers to experiment QScintilla be embedded into HbIDE and 
          had found it to be very limited ( around 2010 ) and have no idea
          what they have implemented later, and, weather it is useful 
          to average HbQt user or not. So any commits for this library 
          has to be maintained by the respective beneficiaries.

       QEvent_Paint brings on-widget drawing capabilities to PRG world.
       This can be the the base for XBase++'s OWNERDRAW create time clause.
       It opens up many interesting ways to redesign the whole interface.
       There is a difference between this and all other events in that 
       the arguments sent to the conncted block are two instead of one.
         .
         oButton := QPushButton( "Cancel" )
         oButton:connect( QEvent_Paint, {| oEvent, oPainter | ;
                          __paintTheButton( oEvent, oPainter, oButton ) }

       Useful for Android builds.

  * hbide/projectpropertiesex.ui
    + FaceLift: added few toolbuttons to be exploied via HbQtEditor().

    + Added: CLASS HbQtEditor.
       It is the replica of HbIDE's editing instnce but with a significant 
       change that now it can be linked with any application like a COM
       object. This has been a very tiring experience but at the same time 
       extremely rewarding.

       When development of HbIDE started, vision was not mature enough to 
       foresee the re-usability of components. HbIDE's all components kept 
       on interwoven madly. HbDBU was developed later which enforced the 
       re-usability pattern. Luckily, now we are in a position to experience 
       the same with another big component, HbQtEditor. 

       The component is mature now. I am using HbIDE as of current but not 
       tested heavily. Normal operations seems to be working fine, so we 
       can start using it. Still a good amount of thoughts are needed for 
       API calls which is still, in my opinion, not done with. You need to 
       wait a little more to deploy it in your apps.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
    + Added; code to demonstrate how to use QEvent_Paint signal.

    + Added: CLASS HbQtSilverLight. 
       A class akin to MS silver-light effects and usage to some extent.
       USAGE:

               a subset of 

  * hbqtwidgets/misc.prg
    + Added: FUNCTION __hbqtAppWidget( oAppWidget ).
       A set/get function which is used throughout the HbQtWidgets where application's 
       main window is a requirement, i.e., HbQtSlidingList() and HbQtSilverLight()
       pulls the parent information via this function.
       This function should be called immediately after constucting the main window
       of the application like:
         oWnd := QMainWindow()
         __hbqtAppWidget( oWnd )
            OR
         oUI := hbqtui_myui()
         __hbqtAppWidget( oUI:oWidget )
         
    + Added: FUNCTION HbQtActivateSilverLight( <lActivate>, [<xContent>], [<oBackground>], ;
                                                   [<lAnimate>], [<aOpacity>], [<oParent>] )
       A general purpose implementation of HbQtSilverLight which can be invoked with 
       this function passing parameters to fine-tune it per requirements.

         lActivate   Mandatory   TRUE switches on, FALSE switches off.

         xContent    Optional    cText | QPixmap | QPicture | QMovie. Default is "Please Wait...".
         oBackground Optional    QColor. Default is QColor( 50,50,50 ).
         lAnimate    Optional    Logical. Default is TRUE.
         aOpacity    Optional    Array. Default is { 127, 200 }.
         oParent     Optional    QWidget derived widget. Default is __hbqtAppWidget().
                                 If oParent could not be found, function does nothing.

       USAGE:

    + Added: code to demnstrate above changes. 
       To experience HbQtSilverLight implementation, drop a Text object onto the 
       canvas, select it, expand <Fonts> tree node on the right-side <Properties>,
       click on <family><Value> node. SilverLight will start animating until 
       fonts info is pulled, and immediately afterwards <Available Fonts> 
       HbQtSlidingList() will appear. This effect is meterialized with 
       HbQtActivateSilverScreen() function with default parameters.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    + Added: void hbqt_bindSwapQtObject( PHB_ITEM pSrcObject, PHB_ITEM pSwpObject ).
       This allows to build descendant class out of parent class which are 
       only possible via Qt's static_cast() function. For example, QGesture() 
       derived classes which are only casted by static_cast() function. The 
       implementation is manifested in three methods added to QGesture.qth, viz., 
       __toPanGesture(), __toPinchGesture() and family.

          :grabGesture( Qt_PinchGesture )

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_misc.prg
    + Added a class HbQtTouchPoint. [ Under Development ]. It is not meant to be

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.ch
    + Added more constants needed for newly added classes.

  * hbqt/qtgui/qth/HBQGraphicsItem.qth
    + Added HbQt specific method QGraphicsPixmapItem * toPixmapItem() returning a 
       QGraphicsPixmapItem from HBQGraphicsItem().

  * hbqt/qtgui/qth/QGesture.qth
    + Added HbQt specific methods __toPanGesture(), etc., swapping the QGesture()
       class object with QPanGesture() object. QGesture() object is destroyed 
       by HbQt engine. The dangling Harbour object stays within scope if not 
       ressigned. So oGesture has to be ressigned as 
         oGesture := oGesture:__toPanGesture | __toPinchGesture() | etc.

    % Many, many changes in implementation.
       API is not stable yet. I have many features on the drawing-board.
       So far now keep on playing with demovisualizer.prg.

  + hbqtwidgets/slidinglist.prg
    + Added:  CLASS HbQtSlidingsManager
               Responsible to manage SlidingLists.

              CLASS HbQtSlidingList
               A QListWidget with special features allowing it to 
               be sliding from left or right edges of parent window.
               This implementation is similar to mobile application 
               showing up a list of options when finger is swiped 
               from outside of the left or right side of the mobile 
               device into to application window. Currently, this 
               implementation is good for left-to-right or right-to-left
               movements. Top-to-bottom and Bottopm-to-top implementation
               is also thought of.

               You can experience it by maximizing the demovisualizer.exe 
               then swiping-in the left or right edges with left-mouse-pressed, 
               which is equivalent to finger-swipe on mobile devices.

    + Added code to supply parameters to HbQtVisualizer framework from the 
       application which demonstrate how this framework can be exploited 
       for variety of purposes.

  ; WARNING : HbQtVisualizer Framework is undergoing a substantial 
              uplift. A lot has been done, but a lot more needs to be done
              before it should be used in production environment. This 
              development is triggedred by my company's needs to carry 
              a variety of tasks through it, especially to manage IT 
              inventory scattered in different locations. This framework 
              will mature to a large extent, stay tuned.

              Today's commit is done because I was loosing grip of changes
              after every successful feature implemention only and also 
              because now it is on a level you can play with it.

    This commit implements following classes extremely useful for 
    desktop as-well-as mobile business applications. Now onwards 
    the primary focus will reamin on the development of re-usable 
    and platform independent components for faster development-to-market
    experience. All these classes I have pulled from my production 
    applications and re-tuned to be useable as COM objects.

    Some of these classes are still in development but I am committing 
    them as is to keep track of the changes as well as in anticipation 
    of your feedback.

    1. CLASS HbQtScrollableToolbar  [ Status - Usable ]
        This class implements a scrollable toolbar which can contain 
        n number of buttons and is usable on any type of device. Toolbar 
        also shows up left-right visual indicators if buttons scroll 
        past the either-side. The look can be controlled by provided 
        methods. Height and width of the buttons, of icons and the 
        gap between buttons is also adjustable. Both, horizontal 
        and vertical orinetations are supported. Toolbars expect 
        QHBoxLayout | QVBoxLayout as its parents.

    2. CLASS HbQtPrintPreview        [ Status - Usable ]
        This class extends the QPrintPreviewWidget with all the eliments
        embedded, as per QPrintPreviewDialog(), but as a components 
        ready to be consumed by a QHBoxLayout or QVBoxLayout. QDilogs
        fare badly on mobile environments so I had a need to have it 
        as a widget with additional elements. Still a couple of methods,
        for real-extended use, are still on my drawing-board. Stay tuned.

    3. CLASS HbQtPropertiesManager   [ Status - Under Development ]
       CLASS HbQtPropertySheet
       CLASS HbQtProperty
        This group of classes is responsible to manage the PropertySheet 
        interface similar like Qt Creator and all other visual tools.
        But here this component may be used for a variety of business 
        needs. For example, implimenting the data-entry screens based 
        on PropertySheet. I am sensing how big usage this interface 
        can provide so every care will be taken to honor Clipper variable
        types. 

    4. CLASS HbQtVisualizer         [ Status - Under Development ]
       CLASS HbQtVisualItems
        These classes implement a COM like embeddable components to manage 
        a variety of business needs VISUALLY. It is the same code base 
        I started as IdeReports which is a part of HbIDE ( though totally 
        non-functional ) via HbXBP engine. Now it is in the process of 
        heavy changes and different vision of usability than it was 
        thought-of at origin. Because it is a MUST requirement for my 
        production development, I hope it will reach its maturity soon.

  + hbqtwidgets/tests/demovisualizer.prg
    + Demo application demonstrating all above components in action.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt.h
    % Moved MSVC related defines before Harbour headers.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp

  * hbide/editor.prg
    ! Fixed: RTE on clicking on <Apply All> in <Themes Editor>.
       Repoted by Itamar, thanks.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed: ( a kind of, regression may surface in other form ), RTE when 
       parent containing the HbQtBrowse object has not been initiated 
       somehow. Reported by Massimo, thanks.

2014-10-03 15:03 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r366)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Cosmetic change:  HBQTUI_PAD_30 => HBQTUI_PAD_35.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    + included patch from Francesco which deletes the SIGNALs physically.
       Tested for all demo apps and HbIDE and has not found any issues.
       This fix seems to be fixing the issue with destructors shown by 
       Luigi.

2014-10-02 16:50 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r365)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    + Improved patch to define SIGNAL/SLOTS at design time, supplied by Francek.

  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbide/actions.prg
    + Added: main-toolbar icon <SaveState> to update hbide.ini and settings.ide
       with current state of HbIDE. The action is exactly the same which 
       is taken at normal exit of HbIDE. It is useful to save state of HbIDE
       intermediately after adding/removing sources/projects, by reorgnizing 
       various components/widgets. It saves you time in case a RTE is generated
       and HbIDE is terminated without saving the latest state.         

  * hbide/edit.prg
    % Changed: Goto Line <CTRL+G> action now positions the cursor in the mid of
       editing instance window.

  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    % Changed: <Opening an Existing Project> now opens the File Open dialog 
       at the last folder visited.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
    ! Fixed: correctly measure the browsers rows when 
       <Tiled>|<Cascaded>|<FullScreen> actions are carried. Before some rows,
       depending upon the resized coordinates, were displayed unsynchronized.

    % Changed: the way <Watches> were being saved in the .wch files. Now 
       watches entries are embedded under <WATCHES>/</WATCHES> block.
       This opens up to use a single file to store many other info. 

2014-09-27 13:42 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r364)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    ! Fixed: to honor correctly :setStyleSheet() and parsing of Q*Gradient()
       calls in .ui. Patch submitted by Francek, thanks.

2014-09-27 11:35 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r363)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r363.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    ! Fixed: to display changed variable if WHEN clasuse returns FLASE.
       Reported by Dusan Majkic, thanks.

2014-09-26 01:55 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r362)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r362.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Changed the 2nd argument to callback in :navigationBlock to send 
       { nX,nY } mapped to window where the clicks originated instead of 
       global nX,nY position. It simplifies a lot of operations.

  * debug/dbgconnect.prg
  * debug/dbgdop.c
    ! Fixed to be compiled with xHarbour.

  * debug/debugger.prg
    + Added: additional fields in SendAreas() where more info is added 
       about the tables, like order, fullpath, indexpath, index info.
       comprising 

  + hbide/debugger2.ui
    + Added MDI compliant debugger interface. 
  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    + Added debugger2.ui.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
  * hbide/saveload.prg
    + Implemented MDI interface to display/exploit debug elements taking 
       use of HbQtBrowse() as the prime component. Besides offering seemless
       freedom to organize and view debug elements, this new protocol is 
       extremely fast as near as console-mode implementation.

       WHY THIS CHANGE: My employers "Curacao" deploys extremely big and 
                        complex application for its business operations 
                        in-development since 1987 gradually ported to 
                        xHarbour from Clipper. This is fondly called "AR".
                        AR is written in the then prevailing coding style 
                        which is termed as "sephaghatti" with hundreds, 
                        nay thousands, of public and private variables 
                        embedded inside macros. When I executed it via 
                        IdeDebugger, it took ages to refresh after every 
                        STEP, just rendering IdeDebugger useless and hence 
                        unacceptable to the management. I explored the 
                        bottlenecks and soon discovered that populating 
                        QTableWidget()'s items was killing it. Communication
                        of debugger and application was just in-time.
                        At one BP debugger UI took many minutes to populate
                        2577 public variables... Simply too much.

       AND THE OUTCOME: After switching to HbQtBrowse() the exchange is 
                        instant. No time-lag. And happily management has 
                        accepted HbIDE and hence IdeDebugger to be deployed 
                        for all fellow developers, at least for debugging 
                        purposes. 

      OTHER BENEFITS: 1 Complete freedome to organize the various elements 
                        to suit the taste and/or need by aspect of debugging.
    
                      2 Feature to Save/Load such organized unlimited "views"
                        even in the same session.

                      3 Drilling-down any multi-dimentional ragged arrays 
                        to last element and view it all-together.

                      4 Preview and Print indivisual elements for future 
                        reference or for cross verification.

      ; Attached image ( separately ) with QtContribs group message will 
        help grasp the true essense of this new interface.
  
2014-09-20 17:25 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r361)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r361.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
    ! Fixed regression not to crash while clicking on <Sets> label.

  * hbide/main.prg
    ! Fixed to close the debuuger ig one has been active at the time 
       HbIDE is <Exit>ed.

2014-09-19 17:25 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r360)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r360.

  * debug/dbgconnect.prg
  * debug/dbgdop.c
  * debug/debugger.prg
    + Added more constructs to honor HbIDE implementation.
    % Changed behavior of some components how these should interact with HbIDE.
    + Added code to supprt xHarbour projects.

  * debug/hwgdebug.hbp
    + Added commented-out switch to turn-on for very old xHatbour builds.

  + hbide/resources/clipboard.png
    + Added new image.

  * hbide/hbide.qrc
    + Added: clipboard.png.

  * hbide/debugger.ui
    % Scheduled to be removed from build.

  * hbide/debugger1.ui
    + Added: few more control to have better debugging experience.
    - Deleted: switching between two ui's. Original ui is deprecated.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented: to pull only the components currently being viewed inside 
       user-interface. For example, if current tab is <WorkAreas> then only 
       workareas related info will be requested from the application. Navigating
       the tabs will pull related info. The info will be pulled once only 
       for each tab until application is suspended after another STOP. 
       In that case all info will be deleted and fresh info downloaded for 
       the tab in view.

       The above implementation has boosted-up the debugging speed per GUI 
       context where populating controls are a big overhead. Also it help 
       to remain responsive in very large applications written in sephagetti 
       style with hundereds of public/private variables hanging around all the
       time. This has increased HbIDE's acceptance many fold.

    + Added: <Download All> button at the right-side corner of main tabs.
       This can be clicked to download info for all components in all tabs.
       But probably you may seldom need to click it in real sessions.

    + Added: <Copy Strucure> icon on the right-side corner of 
       <Record Inspector> component which is clubbed in <WorkAreas> tab.
       This copies to the clipboard something like this:
          LOCAL aStruct := { { "FIRST"   , "C",   20,  0 },;
                             { "LAST"    , "C",   20,  0 },;
                             { "HIREDATE", "D",    8,  0 },;
                             { "MARRIED" , "L",    1,  0 },;
                             { "AGE"     , "N",    2,  0 },;
                             { "SALARY"  , "N",    6,  2 },;
                             { "NOTES"   , "C",   70,  0 } }
       The intent is to provide a mechanism where structure info could be 
       consumed as a variable directly in the source code.

    + Implemented: to change value of vriables.
       Double-click on <Value> column in miscallaneous variables tab.
       If the variable is of type C,D,N,L, then ui will allow to edit it. The 
       changed value will be applied instantly in the application. Resumed 
       execution will honor its value. Note that variables of type character 
       are always displayed inside double-quotes. You must not overwrite 
       them when editing.

    + Implemented: a way to send any information from within the application
       to be published in HbIDE's <Output Console> similar like any debugging 
       tool. You can call it <IdeTrace>. We will refer it by this name onwards.
       It is on top of the debugger protocol. It is a very powerful mechanism
       to measure the performance of your code based on inserting it at 
       crucial points in source code. As <Output Console> prefixes every message 
       with time in seconds, which can become the basis of judging the 
       performance of your code. You will add something like this lines:
          #ifdef __HBIDE_DEBUG__
             IdeTrace( { "This is real-time push!", "This is another push!!" } )
          #endif
          #ifdef __HBIDE_DEBUG__
             IdeTrace( xVariable )
          #endif
          #ifdef __HBIDE_DEBUG__
             IdeTrace( "Customer info is missing" )
             IdeTrace( { 6030, "Nevada Ave", ctod( "" ), .T. } )
          #endif
       Any type of variable is accepted, either an array of variables or literals.
       You need not to #define __HBIDE_DEBUG__, HbIDE's build system automatically
       defines it for debug builds. You can keep above debug points intact 
       for all types of builds.
 
       Backdrop: as you know I had zero knowledge how Harbour debugger works,
                 I struggled at times to understand how the flow of request/response 
                 behaves. For this I had to devise a mechanism where I could know
                 what is happening at the back-end. After it got implemented, 
                 I realized how powerful it could be. Not only for debugging info,
                 but also for measuring performance between two execution points.
                 This simulates Qt creator's debugger protocol to an extent.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqplaintextedit.cpp
    ! Fixed: not to set BreakPoint if line is empty or starts with "/" or "*".
    % Changed: the icon painted over line-number of line set for break-point.
       
  * debug/debugger.prg
    ! Fixed: regression where HbOrderInfo( DBOI_FULLPATH ) is returning NIL 
       instead of empty string if index-file path could not been determined.
       I believe this happens for certain RDDs. I tested DBFCDX which returns
       index-file path as empty string in this situation. Needs to be reported 
       to harbour-devel. Reported by Ash, thanks.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Implemented to consume HbDBu specific table-info string in the format:
        Main,C:\harbour\tests\test.dbf,TEST,DBFCDX,0,500,2,0 0 300 504,21,1,,,,
            =>

      on the command line needed to fire the component via debugger's 
      WorkAreas table (Read Below).

  * debug/debugger.prg
    + implemented to return more information about the work areas. 

  * hbide/debugger.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    ! Fixed: two regressions reported by Itamar, thanks.

    + Implemented tooltip on <Alias> field of <WorkAreas> table depicting 
      some more information about this workarea:
       1. TABLE_PATH  - c:\harbour\tests\test.dbf
       2. INDEX_PATH  - c:\harbour\tests\test.cdx
       3. ORD_TAG_EXP - 1 : LAST : test->last
       4. <INDEXES>
          [ 1 : LAST ] test->last
          ...
          ...
          </INDEXES>

    + Implemented opening the selected workarea in <WorkAreas> in either

  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented: Text lines dumped in <Output Console> are now prefixed 
       with Seconds() with 3 decimal places. The ideas is to have a 
       generic profiler which serves two purposes:
        1. Identified each line with a number useful to ask support 
           questions in context of this identifier.
        2. To measure the time taken in between two actions.

    + Restructured the whole engine how debugger and application communicates.
       In console mode debugger mechanism there is only one way ( at a time )
       to transfer control from debugger to application or vice-versa.
       But in a GUI debugger it is not possible. The actions are initiated 
       independently by the debugger and application which are suseptible to 
       dead-lock type situations more often. I have tried to overcome 
       this problem and have been successful greatly. Ultimately, you will 
       be the better judge to tell how good it is behaving.

       This exercise has resulted in a faster execution also.

    ! Fixed: behavior of Qt_Key_Tab which was tabbing the entire selection 
       inclusing the last row also ( stream-selection ). In reality, 
       last row must never be affected. Pointed-to and justified by 
       Fernando Athayde.

       showing the editor beem cursor instead of arrow cursor.
       Again brought to notice by Fernando Athayde. Many thanks.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r355.

  * debug/dbgconnect.prg
    + Added code which will be useful for next generation debugger.
       After each response written in response file, handle is closed 
       and opened again. This action initiates date-stamp change 
       on the response file which in turn is being "watched" by the 
       debugger. For now it facilitates to log so many things in 
       "Output Console".
       
  * hbide/debugger.ui
  * hbide/debugger1.ui
    + Added button <btnExpand> in the title area of <Object Inspector>.
       Clicking on this button automatically drill-down the elements of 
       type array, formats them, and finally presents the drilled values
       of entire array ( from the point click is initiated ) in a 
       stay-on-top simpel editor, just like code-fragments, syntax highlighted
       and ready to be sent to printing preview. 
       Expand operation can be performed on the variable of type object also.
       In this case only array members will be expanded along-with variables 
       and methods list.
       WARNING: large arrays may take longer period, so use it with caution.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
    % Changed: debugger info copied to clipboard via <Clipboard> button will 
       fire a stay-on-top widget containing the debug info. This is the same 
       editor deployed for <btnExpand> output as above. The only difference 
       is in the highlighter theme which is different in both cases.

    ! Fixed: to honor the break-points in real-world scenario. Till now 
       BPs were initiated only from editing instances hosting the source 
       contained in the project. It had a severe side-effect. A project 
       may contain sub-projects or mere libraries were sources contained
       in those libraries cannot be determined prehand and it rendered the 
       whole process ineffective.

       Now clicking on line-number area on any editing instance tried to set 
       BP on current project being debugger. If the source name is matched 
       inside debug info retained by the application, it is entertained, 
       otherwise discarded. So the onus to determine a valid BP is transferred 
       to Harbour debug engine.

       clicking on an array or object entry in <Object Inspector> table.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    % Version bump to r351.

  * debug/dbgconnect.prg
    % Initialization of debugger is changed to honor only one-way, that is, 
       when fired from within HbIDE. Originally HwgDebugger is designed to 
       to be fired either-way, application-to-debugger or debugger-to-app.
       This fixes race conditions in certain situations.

  * hbide/debugger.ui
  * hbide/debugger1.ui
    + added <SwitchUI_1|2> pushbuttons to activate either of the two 
       interfaces developed in recent days. It is a handy feature to switch 
       to the view most suitable for a particular purpose. The only point 
       of note is that interface resfresh completely only on next BP or STEP.

  * hbide/debugger.prg
  * hbide/edit.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented: <F5 GO>, <F10 STEP> and <F8 TOCURS> keyboard navigation.
       Requested by Maurizio.

    ! Fixed not to show the highlighted row where debugger is stopped 
      at initialization which was causing great confusion. 

    + Implemented: separation of location of different components of a project;
       1. Sources - keep sources as and where you already have.
       2. Project - keep project file .hbp anywhere you want.
       3. Executable - keep executable anywhere required per production setup.
       4. Run Executable - from folder as per your production/development setup.

       So, if you have scenario like this ( per my company )
          Source Folder    - h:\DevAR\dev, h:\DevAR\dev\*source-sub-folders
          Project Folder   - h:\DevAR\dev
          Execuable Folder - h:\DevAR\exes ( contains all dlls required )
          Exe Run Folder   - r:\artest     ( executable must be run from here )

       Then, HbIDE's debugger implimentation now supports it. How:
       .
       1. Build your project .hbp as usual as you would do for a normal project.
       2. Open <Project Properties> dialog.
       3. Enter folder path from where executable should start in <Start In> 
          field. In above example it would be "r:\artest".
       4. Enter parameters needed to execute ( if any ) in <Launch Parameters>
          field. We do not have to pass with out executable in above example.
       5. Click on <Build Debugg and Launch> from <MainMenu><Build>.

       Probably, this will cover <Dos 3> error reported by Maurizio.
       Please test and let me know it debugger is working as intended or 
       something more is needed. I want to close HbIDE Debugger topic.

  * hbide/debugger1.ui
    + Added: another tabWidget based debugger interface.
       By default new interface is active. In case you want to bring back the

    + Implemented: hightlighting the source lin in editing instance where 
       debugger is stopped at any given point of time. Requested by Francek.

    % The line where debugger is stopped is now always scrolled to center 
       of the editing instance vertically.
    
    + Implemented: expanding the wild cards used in source entries in .hbp 
       which gets reflected in project node in "Projects Tree".
       So if an entry like :  c:\dev_source\vouch\*.prg is encountered then 
       all the .prg(s) deposited in "c:\dev_source\vouch" folder will be 
       added to the project tree. Requested by Francek.

    + Initialization of debugger where it calls the debugged application is 
       now done in a detached process. It may ( not sure ) solve problem 
       reported by Maurizio where custom error handler crashes the application.

    + Many small improvements leading to better debug session.

       locate source files inside HbIDE debugger if path to such source 
       could not been located through project file .hbp. Please note that 
       order of such path entries is very much relevant to this protocol.
       HOWTO:
        1. Open <MainMenu><Setup><HbIDE Setup><Projects>.
        2. Click on <Add> button contained in <Source Paths> groupbox.
        3. Navigate to the desired folder in folder selection dialog.
        4. Click "Open". 
        5. Keep a watch on order of folder selection. Sources will be 
           opened from first path they are contained in.
        6. Add as many entries as needed.
        7. To be sure that HbIDE remembers these settings, exit and 
           execute it again.

       Play with the debugger. Please report back if you find bugs or 
       if you need any other feature not there yet.

    - Removed: postpending "_d" with the ${hb_targetname}. It has side-effects
      difficult to manage. For example the project will never be able to 
      resolve sub-projects or library names, etc. Switching from debug to 
      production executable, make a small change in some of your sources 
      so that project is linked again. Thi is the only overhead which I 
      thought of avoiding but ended up in other problems.

    + Implemented: following actions for Watches:
       1. Paste  : adds a new watch by pasting selected text in active 
                   editing instance. It equals to clicking on <Add> icon 
                   and then manually inputting the expression. 
       2. Add    : as usual adds a new record in Watches browser awaiting 
                   input for expression.
       3. Save   : saves the list of Watch expressions into a disk file 
                   with ".wch" extention and prefixed by project name plus 
                   "_". Suppose you provide "first" as the name of the 
                   file in File Selection dialog then saved file will be 
                   like: debuggedProjectName_first.wch. You can have as many 
                   sets as you like. If you select an exiting file then that 
                   will be overwritten with visible expressions.
       4. Restore: restores expressions off the saved .wch files as above.
                   Two options are provided while restoring; 
                   a. Merge loaded expression with existing ones.
                   b. Clear existing expressions and load from file.
       5. Delete : as usual deletes the current selected expression.
       6. Clear  : remove all expressions from the Watches list.

    + Implemented: debugger protocol in HbIDE's main-stream build engine.
      POINTS TO NOTE
      --------------
      1. You will always construct a project normally as per 
         production standards.    
      2. You will never add any debug related switches in the .hbp project file.
      3. You will only select <Build Debug and Launch> family of options
         either from the <MainMenu><Build> or via context-menu of project 
         node in <Projects Tree>.
      4. HbIDE will post-pend the built executable with "_d" for debug builds.
      5. HbIDE will create a "debug" sub-folder in the folder pointed-to 
         by -workdir switch. If no such switch is detedted in .hbp then
         ".hbmk/${hb_plat}/${hb_comp}/debug" will be used.
      6. You will never be asked to open the "HbIDE Debugger" dock yourself.
         Any debug built will open it automatically. The debugger interface 
         will close itself once <Exit> is clicked.
      7. HbIDE manages all the complexities of production and debug builds 
         transparently and auomatically without any conflics.

      WHAT ELSE ? Just enjoy.

       and non-rectangular code of Harbour's native debugger.
       I added some missing features which were added to Harbour debugger, 
       probably, later than Kresin wrote his library.

    + Added: methods essential to integrate debugger protocol. 
       Courtesy: Alex. I just changed the identifiers to confirm to 
       HbIDE laid rules.
    
    Harbour's debugger is brought to HbIDE by Alex based on Kresin's
    communication layer which separates the user-interface from its core.
    This separation makes it possible to embbed this protocol in any 
    GUI/Console environment and for any type of Harbour/xHarbour 
    compiled application.

    PREREQUITES: ( for this version only. In future theme may change. )
      1. Compile QtContribs (recompile not needed). It will build 
         hwgdebug library and will deposit in the folder with rest of 
         the libraries.

      2. Spread sources belonging to the debugged project on same View.
         Only those sources where you want to put the break-points needs 
         to be visible on the active view.

      3. Put the break-points by clicking on a line on Line-Numbers area
         of editing instance. Such click will toggle the break-point.
         The source line will turn RED if a break-point is installed.

      4. To be on the safer side, exit HbIDE and execute it again.
         All break-points you initiated in previous run will re-appear.

      5. Only build the project. Do not launch. Click on the "Debugger" 
         icon on the main toolbar. A left-hand side docking debugger widget 
         will appear. Resize it to suit your preferences.

      6. Click on "Build" menu on the main menu-bar then click on 
         "Launch Debug". Application will be fired and will stop execution 
         on first break-boint it will encounter. Debugger interface will
         show up data in its many widgets. Rest you all know how to operate
         the debugger. 

      7. Here are some instructions specific to HbIDE interface:
         a. Double-click on any work-area entry will refresh "Current Record"
            displaying record information of clicked work-area.

         b. Double-click on any entry in "Variables" table will refresh the 
            "Object Inspector" widget containing relevant information of 
            clicked variable. Only variables of type (O)bject or (A)rray 
            can be inspected this way. Currently array can be inspected 
            for primary elements only. Sub-arrays values cannot be inspected.

         c. Click on "Add" button to intiate a new "Watch" and then 
            double-click in "Expression" field. Punch-in or copy a Harbour
            expression and press <Enter>. Its current value will be 
            reflected in "Value" field. You can add as many "Watches" 
            as you like. To delete a watch first select the entry and then 
            click on "Delete" button. Watches are not saved in current vesrion.

    ASSUMPTION: ( for current version only )
      1. Project file (.hbp), sources (.prg.c.cpp.hb), executable ({win}.exe)
         must reside in same folder.
  
      2. Project file (.hbp) must contain following entries:
           -b
           -lhwgdebug
           -lhbdebug

      3. Possessing some knowledge about Harbour debugger can greatly help
         you to understand the basics of debugger but certainly is not 
         neccessary.

    Many more enhancements are planned for the final version. This is just the 
    begining. The most important enhancement should be to implement it 
    transparently inside <Build and Launch> mechanism without the need to 
    add debugger specific switches inside .hbp. For this to happen a hbmk2 
    provided macro "hb_debug" or similar is required to be used in -workdir 
    switch. If you happen to know if this macro is available in hbmk2, please 
    let me know.

    + Implemented a sub-menu in context-menu of "Prohject Tree" which 
       offers to "Compile and Launch with..." one of the selected 
       environment. The action is equivalent to merging two actions 
       1. Select an Environment
       2. Build and Launch
       from the same context menu. 

    ; It is a productivity feature. It is usefule, rather extremely useful, 
      where one develops applications with multiple compilers and versions.
      For me it is useful for Android based applications which I have to
      compile for desktop also (mostly) to see if all components are working,
      and when satisfied, compile for Android. This feature facilitates to 
      stay with one environment for all projects and allows me to select

    % Editing instance context menu option "Apply Theme" => "Change Theme".

    ! Fixed "Change Theme" correctly applying the changed theme highlighting.

    + Implemented availability of "Themes" list as context-menu options in 
       context menu of editing instance under "Change Theme" sub-menu. 
       Before another interface (not very intuitive) was presented 
       to select a theme.

    + Implemented jumping to last editing position with CTRL+L.
       So far CTRL+L was returning to last viewing position after clicks 
       to Functions List tree. This was limiting functionality and is available
       as is. It is logical that one always needs to return to position he 
       left as editing before navigating to other parts of the source by 
       arrow keys, scrollbar actions, or search operations.
  
    ! Fixed not to generate RTE when CUIEditor is invoked. This interface 
       was working fine absolutely. There seems to be some changes how 
       Inkey( 0 ) behaves in Harbour. Probably it is not releasing CPU 
       time-slices any more, but I am not sure. In a combined CUI and GUI 
       application Inkey( 0 ) may force GUI components to freeze.
       I need to ask Przemek for analysis on this part. I just changed 
       Inkey( 0 ) to Inkey() and everything worked.

    % Changed HbIDE main toolbar size to confirm to device pixels than 
       absolute pixels per changes in other toolbars. The effect is evident in 
       latest very high resolution monitors like "Retina Displays".

  * hbide/edit.prg
  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/functions.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbide/saveload.prg
    + Implemented: Opening of #included files directly from within the 
       editing instance. The file is opened in a always-on-top widget 
       and is supported by "Evening Glamour" theme. The window has two 
       actions only besides standard editing menu (cut|copy|paste):
        1. CTRL+P  Print Preview
        2. CTRL_S  Save

    ; HOW TO CONFIGURE
       1. Open <Setup><HbIDE Setup><Projects>.
       2. In <Include Paths to Open Header Files> groupbox, click on <Add>.
       3. Select a folder containing header files with .ch and/or .h ext.
       4. Add as many folders you might have for your projects.
       5. Keep in mind the order of the provided folders. A header 
          is searched sequentially and is opened from first location 
          it is found.
       6. Once first editing window is opened, resize an position where 
          it does not hide editing tabbed area of HbIDE. Next window 
          window will inherit the size and position of previous window.
          You can close it when not required. Next invokation of same 
          header will show the closed instance exactly on same position 
          where it was before. Note that this info is not saved with 
          HbIDE settings. You will rearrange the first invoked window 
          again.
       7. Click <Close> when finished.

    ; HOW TO INVOKE
       1. Double-Click on the filename part of the header line.
          #include "hbqtgui.ch" - click somewhere inside "hbqtgui".
       2. See a tiny window appearing on top of HbIDE interface.
          Rearrange and resize per desktop territory. 

          That's it.   

    ; This is a very useful and productive feature from a developers 
      point-of-view. At times I ever wished to have this feature to save 
      many actions to search where the header is deposited.

    + Enhanced: how keywords in dictionaries were being loaded and managed.
       This has improved the opening of files and editing flow many-fold.

2014-07-27 20:46 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r321)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    ! Fixed: a bug being result of the latest developments in HbQt.
       The GPF was produced when a browser instance was closed via 
       X button click in certain circumstanced. Mere rearrangement of 
       source lines fixed this issue.

    + Added: toolbar actions and implementation:
      1. Save Environment    - Saves the state of splitters, panels, tables
                               etc. in the default "hbide.dbu" file.
      2. Save Environment As - Asks for a filename with .dbu extention
                               and saves above values therein.
      3. Merge Environment   - Asks to select a .dbu file and merges the 
                               environment with existing state.

      This feature is very useful to embed HbDBU as a COM interface into 
      your application. Now This is implemented in HbIDE, read below.

         via clicks in <Functions List>. Feature requested by Alex. 
         I wanted to enhance it to return last position with all navigational
         keys like UP | DOWN | PAGEUP | PAGEDN | SCROOLBAR ACTIONS |ETC
         but faced some issue. Will revisit it later.

      2. Column-Selection protocol is enhaced with a formatting feature
         where text on the LEFT or RIGHT of selection marker can be 
         aligned up the selection-marker.
         HOW TO:
          1. Switch on the column-selection via <Toggle Selection Mode> icon.
          2. Place cursor on a column which will attract the alignment.
          3. Select rows by Shift+Down Arrow which are subject to have aligned.
             Make sure that you do not select any other columns and the 
             selection block is visible as a thin vertical line. Let us
             call it as "selection-marker".
          4. On the Selected-Text-Toolbar, which will popup as soon as you 
             start selection process, click the last icon <Align At>.
          5. In the resulting input dialog, type "\L" or "\R" without quotes.
          6. If you typed \L then all text to the right of selection-marker 
             will align-left to its postion. If you typed \R then all the text 
             on the left of selection marker will align-right to marker
             positionn.
          ;  The feature is very handy in formatting source where some parts 
             or many rows needs to be aligned at a certain position.

          ;  Already available features from this interface ( just to refresh )
             \[0-9]   -   Regular Expression.
             \nn      -   Where <nn> represents the column position.

      3. Opening a context menu with right-click on the tabs in editors 
         interface, requested by Jayadev. Currently this offers 
         <Save>, <Close> and <Print> options. let me know what else can 
         be added here.
             
      4. <Build and Launch> now supports extended protocol to launch the 
         executable in addition to existing protocol. The extended protocol 
         facilitates to setup the current envirnment settings before 
         launching the application. Current "Environment" means the entry
         shown in "Env:" section of HbIDE's statusbar. This effectively 
         means all the SETs defined in the hbide.env#<env:> section are 
         set via shell command and then application is fired. It is equivalent 
         to running a batch file on command prompt which also calls the 
         application. 

         This feature facilitates you to SET the environment variables 
         from outside the application. From a developers point of view 
         it allows you to compile a single application, in a single session
         of HbIDE, for multiple compilers and versions. I use this feature 
         extensively for HbQt based applications against Qt 4x and 5x.

         HOW TO:

         1. Open and navigate to <Main Menu><Setup><HbIDE Setup><Projects>.
         2. Check the Extended <Build and Launch> checkbox.
         3. <Compile and Launch> some project.
         4. Give attention to a console window appearing for a fraction of 
            a second and then disappearing, just prior to compiled app
            is launched.

         ;  The only drawback of this feature is the appearnce of console
            window but enhances your productivity many-fold.

    ! Fixes
      -----
      1. Adding | Modifying a new source entry in Project file .hbp via 
         <Project Properies> dialog was not reflecting the changes in 
         <Project Tree> immediately. Pointed out by Jayadev.

    % Changes 
      -------
      1. Background color of <Selected Text Toolbar> to have a more sobbering 
         but distinct look so that it is not lost in the background text
         and is prominently visible.

      2. Positioning of <Selected Text Toolbar> has been reworked to 
         facilitate better experience.

      3. IdeDBU, HbIDE contained component, is switched to, and in 
         synchronization with, HbDBU. The saved environment files (.dbu) 
         are shareable. Infact the fully functional HbQtDbu is embedded 
         in HbIDE as like a COM interface. This demonstrates the usefulness 
         and versatility of HbQtDbu which you can embbed in your 
         applications also.

    ; Thanks to Alex who has show the group that how QtSql modules can 
      be used for production. Please note that you have to recompile 
      Sql drivers client libraries yourselves, as demonstrated by Alex.
      This is beyond the scope of HbQt to include those drivers in the 
      repository. This was the main reason I never gave enough attention 
      to QSql classes constructors.

    This commit brings Qt complient QZXing Library, based on ZXing Library, 
    to Harbour. This library enables you to scan Linear and 2D barcodes.
    Barcode detection is immensely useful in business applications. I have 
    changed only a few lines of code needed to port the code to Harbour 
    build system. I also have changed the names of two files which was 
    necessary to build the lib per Harbour specs. Rest everything is the 
    same as per its original repository.

    I have tried to remain compliant with its licensing issues by having 
    two files COPYING and NOTICE in the root folder. Please overlook me if 
    I have done it right.

    A comprehensive demo code will be committed in few days, just polishing 
    few finer points. The library is useful both for desktop and mobile 
    applications. For Android we have to wait until QtMultimediaWidgets 
    module is fully supported for this platform.

       The example is the exact replica of example shipped with Qt 5.3.0.
       The behavior of the example is not exactly how it should be. It
       seems some bug in Qt itself because the same example code run
       via QtCreator also behaves exactly like Harbour's.
       Any input is welcome.

  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    - Commented out code which was forcing the all required classes to be present.
       With the new versions of Qt, at times some methods could not be avialble
       in prior versions and hence linking an application was failing. A link
       will eventually fail if a class is not available, anyway, at link time,
       so exculsion of these forced classes do not pose any issues.
       Reported by CDQ.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_init.cpp
    + Added code to look for a function __hbqtLibraryPath() linked with the
        application and call as
        QCoreApplication::addLibraryPath( __hbqtLibraryPathReturnString ).
        I could find this way efficient enough where such requirement is sought for.
        Requested by CdQ.

        FUNCTION __hbqtLibraryPath() ; RETURN hb_dirBase() + "Plugins" and deposit
        all plugin folders there.

    + Added: another demo code to demonstrate how many components of
       HbQtWidgets can be combined with Qt Creator created UI and
       embedded into its controls. It also demonstrate what methods
       can be adopted to release memory properly.

       is closed.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_misc.prg
    ! Restructured: binding Harbour variables to Qt objects.
       Now a HbQt object is referenced only once and hence Harbour GC calls
       the varible destructor properly. This has made it possible to reclaim
       memory after Qt frees the object pointers, either initiated by Harbour
       or by Qt. This commit is very important and I hope that HbQt is
       now production ready.

    ; INCOMPATIBLE: the only side-effect, seen by many Harbour programmers,
       is that any variable holding a Qt object which is :connect()ed will
       have to live according to Harbour scoping rules. Before HbQt was
       keeping that variable alive by adding the object to an instance
       variable of another class which effectively was blocking Harbour
       GC to destroy the Qt object.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqabstractitemmodel.cpp
    + Added: one HB_TRACE() call.

    + Added: methods and code to destroy Qt objects held in instance variables
       of above classes. As a rule, every specialized widget must implement
       :destroy() method responsible to destroy Qt objects used for the class.
       QGet and HbQtBrowse now has :destroy() method.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validatormain.ui
    + Added: code to destroy the Qt objects.

  ; This commit takes HbQt to production level. Object destruction is proper.
     Memory management is proper. It has been four-and-a-half years to reach
     this goal. Cheers.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbtoqt.ch
    + Mapped: LastKey() to __hbqtSetLastKey().
       LastKey() will return the last key pressed within a QGET/QREAD session.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added:  @ <top>, <left>, <bottom>, <right> QGET <v> HBQTBROWSE <oHbQtBrowse> ...
              @ <top>, <left>, <bottom>, <right> QGET <v> IMAGE ...

  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    + Added: code to manipulate HbQtBrowse and Images via QGET/QREAD engine,
       just like any other object.

       For @....QGET <lValue> HBQTBROWSE <oBrowse> ..., you will
       typically construct a browse object and will pass it as <oBrowse>.
       While within the browse object all your navigation instructions will
       work as ususal. K_CTRL_ENTER will exit the browser GET and focus will
       be shifted to next GET in the GetList.

       For @....QGET <cImageNameFromResourceOrDisk> IMAGE ..., you will pass
       the image name either from embedded resource or a name of disk file.
       Later you can change the image via standard GET behaviour as:

         LOCAL cImage := ":/myapp/myfav.png"  // OR "c:\myicons\myfav.png"

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed: click on a ghost (blank) row was posing ghost row as current row.
       A long pending issue resolved.

    + Added: some more methods ( experimental yet ).

    + Added: METHOD initializationBlock( bBlock )           SETGET
               This method is called right after HbQtBrowse become stable the
               first time.

    + Added: METHOD keyBoard( cnKey )                       INLINE __hbqtKeyboard( cnKey, ::oTableView )
               A handy method to apply keys to an HbQtBrowse object.

    + Added: DATA   oGetList
             DATA   oGetObject
             METHOD setGetObject( oGetObject )              SETGET
               Internal methods and members to bind a HbQtBrowse object to
               a QGET/QREAD interface. Browser is entered for navigation
               if standard WHEN clause returns TRUE. The same is true with
               VALID clause. K_CTRL_ENTER will set set the focus to next
               GET in the current GETLIST.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtevent.prg
    ! Fixed: a nasty side-effect.

  * hbqtwidgets/dashboard.prg
    + Added: members
             DATA   oGetEdit
             DATA   oTextEdit
             DATA   oGetEditTimer
             DATA   oGetEditText                            INIT ""

             METHOD manageUDF( cText )

        This commits changes the way DashBoard objects are created. Now objects
        are created irrespective of if tey contain any data, and when data arrives
        is populated therein. Also "Text" object has gone an overall change.

  * hbqtwidgets/misc.prg
    + Added: __hbqtSetLastKey().
       A GET/SET function available to the PRG code via LastKey() console
       function during a QGET/QREAD session.

  ; DONE: a descent demo program to demonstrate embedded browse and images
          inside QGET/QREAD mechanism.

  * hbqt/qtcore/qth/QStandardPaths.qth
    ! Guarded: :setTestModeEnabled() under QT_VERSION 0x050200.
       In Qt documentation it is not mentioned but compiling with Qt 5.1.1
       failed on this member, so seems it has been introduced in Qt 5.2.

  * hbqt/qtnetwork/qth/filelist.hbm
    + Added: above new classes.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.ch
    + Added: QtNetwork namespace specific constant usable with above classes.

  ; NOTE: this completes the implementation of QtNetwork which offers really
          powerful classes to manage networks. This I realized after a
          project which I did on pure Qt. I am hoping that the same big
          project would materialize with HbQt also.

          Above classes have been tested to be compilable with Qt 4.8.5
          and Qt 5.2. If you find any issues with another version of
          Qt please speak.

2013-11-21 16:42 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r264)
  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Added: SetKey( K_INS, {|| ReadInsert( ! ReadInsert() ) } )
       for edits to behave in Clipper manner.

  * hbqtwidgets/alert.prg
    % Changed: returns NIL is HbQtBukGet() is terminated with ESC or X button.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: a toolbar button <Show cell contents in memo>.
       Activating it will open a small sheet containing contents of active cell.
       It is helpful to view fields with larger length than it is visible in the
       browser window. The memo has all standard operations.

  * hbqtwidgets/resources/memo.png
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
    + Added: another icon to invoke MemoEditor for active column content.

  + hbqtwidgets/calculator.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: HbQtCalculator() class developed by M.Ronaldo, many thanks.
       I added these few improvements:
         1. Formatted as per Harbour specs.
         2. Opted for Qt_Sheet widget instead of QDialog.
         2. Memo made visible by a toolbar button. It is not always desired.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
    + Added: call about usage of HbQtCalculator().

  * hbqtwidgets/alert.prg
    + Added: <xIcon> in HbQtBulkGet( ..., <xIcon> ).

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added; DBRD_ATTRB_TEXT_* constants.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: hbqtwidgets.hbx

  * hbqtwidgets/dashboard.prg
    + Implemented: A QTextEdit based <Text> object.
      ATTRIBUTES:
        { cFontName, nFontHeight, cnColor, lNoWrap, lKeepAppending, nMSecsToClearBuffer }

          cFontName           => "Courier New"
          nFontHeight         => 18
          cnColor             => "N/W+" OR  {{12,121,200},{212,24,157}}
          lKeepAppending      => .F. => .T. if new text keeps on appended
          nMSecsToClearBuffer => NIL => MilliSeconds if Buffer has to be cleared

    ; NOTE: this object has proved to be the most valuable one in my applications
            and has been much appreciated by my clients. There are many use cases
            this can be applied for, for example, price-checker feature. On a
            separate system with 29 inches monitor, he keeps open the dash-board
            only. He uses <Banner> object to display in-time offers. At the lower
            portion he displays a <Text> object with a small module with just one
            HbQtGet accepting a hand-held scanner input. Based on barcode, VALID
            block of that GET fetches the MRP and other info of the product and
            send the resulting text to this <Text> object. No need of any external
            tool to implement Price-Checker otherwise. Hope you will also be benefitted.

  + hbqt/hbqtwidgets.hbc
    + Added: .hbc to be recognized by hbmk2 for out of tree projects.
       Now this is enough to add a line in {project}.hbp as
        hbqtwidgets.hbc
       This may solve many support questions on the list.

2013-06-24 13:27 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r246)
  * hbxbp/hbpprocess.prg
    % Changed: process channel mode to merge process's stdour and stderr
       output to stdout. this should fix the reported missing (ocassionally)
       output dump in Output Console of HbIDE.

2013-06-22 01:00 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r245)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    ! Fixed: population of version information based on env vriable instead
       of detecting REBUILD logic from hbmk2 variables, as hbmk2 do not
       pass all command line switches to plugins, and Viktor has not
       responded to my query on the devel-list.

       When rebuilding qtcontribs,
         set QTCONTRIBS_REBUILD=yes
       prior to the build process. This you may need to do only
       once per version of Qt.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_version.ch
    ! Defaulted to Qt 4.x.

2013-06-22 00:36 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r244)
  * hbide/editor.prg
    % Minor.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqproxystyle.cpp
    % Minor.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/hbmk.hbm
    + Added: -mt switch.

  * hbqtwidgets/dashboard.prg
    + Implemented: Threaded data-collection protocol, if app is compiled
       with -mt switch. This greatly enhances appln load-time and keep
       the GUI always responsive. Objects are created as soon as appn
       starts, but data is only populated when data collection routine
       is finished at the background.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/dashbrd.prg
    % Slight optimization, better control of icons.

2013-06-19 17:55 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r243)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Enabled: ocde to fire :pressHeaderBlock() for frozen columns.
       Not tested. Please respond if behavior does not confirm to
       standards.

  * hbqt/tests/dbfbrowserclass.prg
    ! Changed: to be compilable with -w3.

  * hbide/edit.prg
    + Implemented:
        Column-Selection
          Only Vertical Thin Line
            Tools Menu - Align At...
              [ESC]cRegEx == \[0-9]|\?
                Text from column-selected text aligned at first occurance
                of a digit character or question-mark character.
                Very handy to align header constants pulled from Qt docs.

2013-06-18 17:15 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r242)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed: residual last minute deletion of control structure, after
       testing with IF .F., then deleting before committing.

  * hbide/edit.prg
    + Implemented:
        Column-Selection
          Only Vertical Thin Line
            Tools Menu - Align At...
              [ESC]nn == \25
                Text from Column Selected onwards shifted to 25th position.

       It is achievable otherwise as; selecting the rows by column and then
       pressing spaces/backspace until desired column was reached.
       This is handy to align text to a certain column.

  * hbqt/tests/dbfbrowser.prg
  * hbqt/tests/dbfbrowserclass.prg
    ! Fixed: to be executable with current Harbour.
       It was broken due to class inheritance mechanism where
       :super() has to be called in :init() method.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed: length of the cell was not respecting dynamic changes in
       oColumn:picture. The values were being calculated only once.

    + Added: oBrowse:horizontalMovementBlock().
       If assigned, will be called as :
        Eval( ::horizontalMovementBlock(), nMovementCode, NIL, Self )
       [ Requested by Zoran ]

  + hbqtwidgets/tests/browgets.prg
    + Added: a browse-cum-gets-with-pictures demonstration application.
       Supplied by Zoran with small changes.

  + hbqt/qtgui/qth/QProxyStyle.qth
    + Added: missed file from prev commit.

2013-06-17 18:39 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r239)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.ch
    + Added: QStyle_* constants.
       This time it was a tedius job as Qt's documentation was
       specifying "?" for many constants which, I had to resort from
       qstyle.h header.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_pointer.cpp
    % Changed: hbqt_obj_isDerivedFrom() converts pszClassname to upper.
       It greatly simplifies to create .qth(s).

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.hbm
  + hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqproxystyle.cpp
  + hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqproxystyle.h
    + Added: basis for implementation of class QProxyModel() via HBQProxyModel().

  * hbqt/qtgui/qth/filelist.hbm
  + hbqt/qtgui/qth/HBQProxyStyle.qth
    + Added: new class HBQProxyStyle() inheriting virtual class QProxyStyle().
       This class brings to PRG layer extremely required feature to owner-draw
       elements and controls. Style Sheets mechanism, though easy to implement,
       but has been inadequate at times to get the desired effects. This
       class offers a robust mechanism to alter all aspects of a window/control.

    NOTE: how to sense the importance of this class:
          Until now painting a widget could only be done via QEvent_Paint event
          which never supplies relevant QPainter which renders it useless to
          intercept and use the way a programmer wants. This class act as a
          proxy to paint event and supplies all needed components to re-draw
          any part of the control.

          This class also covers an irritating behavior ( at times ) of Qt where
          Style Sheet is applied on every child of the widget. QProxyStyle()
          is said to be applied locally for only for the widget it is set.

          This also eliminates the need to sub-class every class of Qt just
          for one reason - how to redraw on a widget.

  * hbqt/tests/demoqt.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate the usefulness of above class. To explore
       just hover the mouse over "Harbour" push-button.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    + Added: code to exploit ReadInsert() to change the text cursor shape
       from Beam to Block for insert/overstrike mode. This again is the
       result of HBQProxyStyle().

  ;NOTE: This class is evolving, so I would request you to experiment
         and return here your feedback.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    % Refined: one more instance of misbehavior in numeric GET, where
       "-" was pressed when minus was already there.

2013-06-13 18:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r237)
  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    ! Fixed: A numeric GET was not rebuilding the PICTURE's TEMPLATE
       part if only FUNCTION part was supplied, like, "@K" or "@ZK", etc.
       It was causing GETs to behave erratically in some circumstances.

    ! Fixed: wrong behavior of numeric GETs as reported by Zoran with
       a useful example code.

    + Implemented: Insert/Overstrike mode in character GETs. It follows
       standard Clipper protocol via ReadInsert() call. So,
         SetKey( K_INS, {|| ReadInsert( ! ReadInsert() ) } )
       toggles between overstrike/insert modes. Just place at
       the top of GETs code.

       NOTE: Above behavior is true for GETs without TEMPLATE part of
             PICTURE clause. If a template is provided, ReadInsert() has
             no effect. Examples:
               @...GET...PICTURE "@KA!"       => SUPPORTED
               @...GET...PICTURE "@K !!AX!!"  => NOT SUPPORTED

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Refined: :cellEdit() code to pass pressed key in proper context.

       based constants which then can be used to distinguish Qt versions
       in header files. This header will be generated if -rebuild flag
       will be passed when building QtContribs.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.ch
    + Added: #include "hbqt_version.ch"

  ; NOTE: Please rebuild QtContribs.
          never commit hbqt_version.ch, it will be changed at build time.
          This solves a lot of issues with version stats.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: dashboard.prg

  + hbqtwidgets/dashboard.prg
    + Implemented: an embeddable DashBoard component.
       This all the important widget will liven your applications with
       manifold acceptance by your clients. It presents the business data
       in meaningful visual representation in real-time, a concept which
       is available in some very high end ERPs only.

       OBJECTS      DashBoard exposes the following objects:
       =======
       1. Figure  : Any expression returning digits, i.e., 216765.52, Time().
                    This object is useful where you want to display running
                    balances or summed figures.

       2. Banner  : A marquee where application can inform the user about
                    anything from simple announcements to new offers.
                    Application vendor also can offer a banner where info
                    is pulled from a web-server. This may enhance your
                    interaction with the end-user.

       3. Graph   : A graphical representation of data. Currently only
                    Bar and Pie charts are available.

       4. Browser : A HbQtBrowse object comsuming a two dimensional array
                    of data which gets updated in real-time.

       5. Picture : A simple slide-show object where image source can be
                    changed as per application's flow. For example, the
                    images souce can be hooked to stock items if a stock
                    master module is activated. Imagination is the limit.

       ANATOMY      The component has the following wings:
       =======
       1. QWidget   Holding all other parts in a QGridlayout.
       2. QTabbar   Exposing multiple stacks/panels hosting various objects.
       3. QToolbar  Top toolbar containing various actions to manipulated
                    objects and other parts of the components.
       4. QToolbar  Left toolbar holding actions to manipulate windows
                    hosting objects.
       5. QStackedWidget Hosting multiple panels.
       6. QMdiArea  Multiple - hosting various windows of objects.
       7. QTreeWidget Hosting application-pushed object definitions invocable
                    by the appln user.
       8. QStatusbar Exposing different parts to provide in-time statistics.

       ACTIONS      Following are the actions available:
       =======
       1. Toolbar-T a) Create a New DashBoard
                    b) Activate another DashBoard
                    c) Create a New Browser Object
                    d)              Figure
                    e)              Graph
                    f)              Banner
                    g)              Picture
                    h) Toggle Objects Tree's Visibility
                    i) Toggle DashBoard/Panels Tabbar's Visibility.

       2. Toolbar-L j) Toggle tabbar of objects visible on active dashboard.
                    k) Position objects on active dashboard with original oordinates.
                    l) Position Objects Cascaded.
                    k) Position Objects Tiled.
                    l) Position Objects Full Screen in Viewport.
                    m) Stack objects Vertically.
                    n) Stack Objects Horizontally.
                    o) Zoom Out Objects.
                    p) Zoom In Objects.

       3. DashBoards/Panels Tabbar ( When toggled to visibility )
                    q) Lock/Unlock Dashboard/Panel.
                    r) Clear DashBoard Objects ( If it is Unlocked ).

       ENVIRONMENT  Following points describe its eco system:
       ===========
       1.           Component passes all the user actions to the application and
                    waits for the appropriate reply which is then carried on.

       2.           It does not save/restore anything at its own. Rather provides
                    the methods to retrieve and push its environment.

       3.           Component can hosted inside any container widget or layout
                    application provides. Itf no parent is supplied then
                    it itself becomes the top-level widget.

  + hbqtwidgets/tests/dashbrd.prg
    + Added: a reasonably self contained application to demonstrate the
       usage of HbQtDashBoard() widget.

    % Rearrangement of some code in logical sections.
      Moved HBQTMDI_* constants to qtstd.ch.

  + hbqtwidgets/charts.prg
    + Implemented: HbQtCharts() class.
       This class is inspired from:
         https://github.com/0TheFox0/OpenChart/blob/master/
           Thanks.

       Charts class is responsible to display graphical representation of
       business data. Currently BAR and 2D PIE charts are available, but
       later many other types will be developed. For LINES and 3D PIE,
       code is already there but needs some tweaks. So those chart types
       are not implemented yet.

         #include "qtstd.ch"

         oParent := QGroupBox( oMain )
         oParent:resize( 300, 200 )

            :create()

            :enableToolbar( .T. )
         ENDWITH

       Charts window contains a left-side, toggleable, toolbar and
       chart display area. Toolbar contains these actions:
         1. Action Display Bar-Chart
         2. Action Display Pie-Chart
         3. Action Toggle Legends
         4. Action Toggle Shadows
         5. Action Toggle Labels
         6. Action Toggle Values
         7. Action Print Preview

       Besides above action-icons, interface offers two keyboard actions:
         P  Action Print Preview
         T  Action Toggle Toolbar

       Charts class can be hosted on any container widget or layout.
       It is also scheduled to be added to @...QGET...BARCHART... and variants.
       For my projects it is used as a part of HbQtDashBoard() object.
       HbQtDashBoard() will be committed next after finalization of
       its usability components.

       Note: Charts class needs more work but it has already showed me
       a promise. Speak-out your ideas and hopefully those will get
       implemented. Also, if someone can write code for other type of
       charts, is welcome. Believe me, I am extremely poor in maths.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    % Changed: the time-line when default rdd driver has to be activated.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Implemented: attaching a non-structural index to an open table.
       A new "Attach an Index" icon is placed adjoining "Open Table" icon,
       which, when activated, will ask for a disk file in a select File dialog.
       All types of files are offered to be selected, to be generic, so that
       applications generating non-standard extenstion could take use of
       this feature. Selected file is supplied with OrdListAdd() function,
       leaving RDD sub-system to determine the next course.

    + Implemented: RDD specific following settings:
       RDDI_STRUCTORD
       RDDI_MULTITAG
       RDDI_MEMOTYPE
        Whenever a RDD Driver is selected from the combobox, a tiny dialog
        is opened to fetch above settings. If OKeyed, then RDDInfo()
        function is called as per selections.

    ; I have never used any other RDD except DBFCDX, so am not
      familiar with exact behavior of other Rdds. So please shout if
      this implementation needs other tweaks.

  - hbqt/gtqtc/*
    - Deleted: GTQTC from QtContribs.
       An extremely powerful version has been committed by Przemek in
       Harbour GIT under contrib/gtqtc. Thank you Przemek for this
       all-the-useful contribution. This fills a wide-gap in using
       Harbour platform-independent without even changing the setup.
       Plus it will provide a solid initiative for console mode
       programmers to turn to pure GUI and having a edge of mixing
       GT and GUI screens. New GTQTC has the power to be run in MT
       mode flawlessly, a powerful offering.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_init.cpp

       and its drawingarea. These are useful to embed console inside
       a GUI form. Look into HbIDE code console.prg how it can be
       achieved.

  * hbqt/tests/browqt.prg
    % Minor.

  * hbqt/tests/demoqtc.prg
    % Modified to honor newly committed GTQTC. It has MT functionality
       just like in GTWVT ot GTWVG.

  - hbqt/tests/wvtqt.hbp
  - hbqt/tests/wvtqt.prg
    - Removed, no longer necessary GTWVT console based HbQt extention.
       This is superceded by demoqtc.prg.

  * hbxbp/crt.prg
    * Changed to retrieve GtQtc console from functions provided by Przemek.

  * qtcontribs.hbp
    - Removed: GTQTC build call.

  * hbide/sources.prg
    ! Fixed: annoying alert "Source has been modified by some external..."
       when, a project is built whole source has been modified and not
       saved before compilation process is started.
       Pushed up by Maurizio.

2013-04-22 17:32 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r211)
  + hbqt/tests/demoqtc.prg
    + Added: demonstration appln based on GTQTC having functionality of
       firing HbQt widget in modal dialog plus GT specific actions.
       It was present in slightly diefferent form when inside Harbour
       SVN and was removed by Viktor.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    * Version bump.
    % Reverting back HbDBU icon to Harbour instead of Cube.

  * hbdbu/hbdbu.hbp
    + Added: switch to tie Harbour icon to the executable

  * hbdbu/hbdbu.ico
    + Harbour icon.

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Version bump.

2013-04-19 13:09 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r209)
  * hbqt/tests/demoqt.prg
    ! Fixed: <Exit> main menu option and ESCaping the main window.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    % Changed: the argument order of AChoice().

  * hbqtwidgets/hbtoqt.ch
    + Added: #xtranslate AChoice(     =>  HbQtAChoice(
             #xtranslate DispOutAt(   =>  HbQtDispOutAt(
             #xtranslate MaxRow(      =>  HbQtMaxRow(
             #xtranslate MaxCol(      =>  HbQtMaxCol(

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: constants _QSAY_* to identify SayList array elements.

  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
    + Implemented: tying the underlying window over which GETs are
       spread to its GetList Object.

    + Implemented: tying of SayList to GetList object in question.
       It is used to reuse SAYs in DispOutAt() calls.

    + Added: __hbqtGetsActiveWindow() to retrieve the current window.
       This function is used to determine DispOutAt(), MaxRow(), MaxCol()
       calls return values.

  * hbqtwidgets/alert.prg
    % Changed: order of additional arguments to HbQtAChoice().
       HbQtAChoice( ..., [<cTitle>], [<oParent>] )
         =>
       HbQtAChoice( ..., [<oParent>], [<cTitle>] )

    + Implemented: near to Clipper AChoice() respecting most of
       the arguments except "cUserFunc".

    + Implemented: Clipper compatible DispOutAt() function as:
       HbQtDispOutAt( <nRow>, <nCol>, <cExp>, [<cColor>], [<oWnd>] )
       [<oWnd>] defaults to __hbqtGetsActiveWindow().

    + Implemented: GT compatible MaxRow() function as:
       HbQtMaxRow( [<oWnd>] )
       [<oWnd>] defaults to __hbqtGetsActiveWindow()

    + Implemented: GT compatible MaxCol() function as:
       HbQtMaxCol( [<oWnd>] )
       [<oWnd>] defaults to __hbqtGetsActiveWindow()

    ; The above functions are only relevent if called from within
      WHEN or VALID clauses for the purpose of determining the
      affected window. This implementation nears the porting efforts.

    ; DispOutAt( nRow, nCol, ... ) exploits existing SAY object if one
       exists at <nRow>,<nCol> created via @ nRow,nCol QSAY ... mechanism.
       If not, then a new object is created at the specified coordinates,
       which in turn is added to the SayList of respective GetList object.

       For all practical purposes, you can reuse existing SAYs.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    + Added: code to publish current GETs window to __hbqtGetsActiveWindow()

  * hbqtwidgets/misc.prg
    + Added: __hbqtGetXYFromRowColumn( oWnd, nRow, nCol, oFont )
               => { nX, nY, nColWidth, nRowHeight }
       It is similar to __hbqtGetGlobalXYFromRowColumn() but returns
       the coordinates calculated from <oWnd>'s origins.

    + Implemented: a handy function to obtain a dialog on top of existing
       window as:
       __hbqtGetADialogOnTopOf( oParent, nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, cTitle, oFont, lResizable )
       The function in turn is used elsewhere in HbQtWidgets code.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate above concepts.

        Reported by Zoran Sibinovic with test code.

  + hbqtwidgets/tests/getsinfo.prg
    + Added: test code to determine various attributes of GETs based on picture
        functions and templates. Test code is provided by Nenad ( as per Zoran's message ).
        I have just refined it to be usable with pure Harbour.
        For HbQt, compile it as : hbmk2 getsinfo -d__QT__ -run -inc.
        For Clipper, compile it as ( and in placing it in harbour/tests ) : hbmk2 getsingo -run -inc.

    ; Please report back if any attribute is still misbehaving.

  * hbide/edit.prg
    % Minor.

  * hbqt/tests/draganddrop.prg
    % Changed: source with SVN Id and some more tweaks, forwarded by Luigi.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: misc.prg.

  + hbqtwidgets/misc.prg
    % Separated: miscellaneous functions spread in HbQtWidgets sources.
    + Added: few more utility functions in a hope that end-user will also
       be needing them at some point of development.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Simplified: code to take use of HbQtWidgets Public API.

  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    ! Fixed: ACCESS oGET:changed
             ACCESS oGET:picture
             ACCESS oGET:unTransform()
                Loosely tested, please shout if not proper.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: another ATTRIBUTE - _QGET_ATTRB_ATROWCOLUMNONTOPOF
             An Array representing { oWnd, nRow, nCol, lMovable }.
             Used to Fetch another GETs on top of a GETs window.
             ( Read Below )

  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
    + Implemented: To fetch another GETs on top of a GETs window passing
       Window, Row, Column, IfMovable coordinates as part of the
       QREAD ... ATTRIBUTES clause. This attribute can be assigned to
       ATTRIBUTES array as
         aAttrbs := {}
         AAdd( aAttrbs, { ... } )
         AAdd( aAttrbs, { _QGET_ATTRB_ATROWCOLUMNONTOPOF,
                              { <oWnd>, <nRow>, <nCol>, [<lIfMOvable>] } } )
       If passed this attribute, a modal dialog will be position on the
       XY position ascertained from <nRow>,<nCol> of <oWnd> based on
       the font set on <oWnd> if that is of type fixedPitch(), otherwise
       via font of current GETs font. If <lIfMovable> is passed as TRUE,
       then dialog will be decorated with a TitleBar but without any
       other buttons, just to facilitate appln user to move it around if
       there is a need, otherwise, dialog will be without a titlebar
       and hence will not be movable.

       This implementation enables us to overcome yet another porting issue
       where one has to write a lot of code to achieve similar functionality.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how another GET window can be initiated
        from within VALID/WHEN clauses forming extention to existing
        GETs.

2013-04-09 02:21 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r203)
   + hbqt/tests/draganddrop.prg

  * ChangeLog.txt
    ! Rewote previous entry # 201.

  * hbide/edit.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
    + Implemented: recognition of text in strings and comments and then
       deactivate code specific operations on keywords, etc., taking
       it as plain text.

       Was a long-overdue feature but did not got attention until now
       when Massimo pointed it out recently.

       For Qt 4.6 and above. Pointed out by Luigi.

2013-04-05 12:24 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r200)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    - Removed: evaluation of column's block with edited value in METHOD editCell(...).
       When I had implemented it like that, was double-minded since begining.
       I could not assert the real time use case scenario how it should
       behave. But recent clarification by Zoran has made my mind clear
       about it. In fact, it should be the responsibility of appln what
       it wants to do with ediited value, not that of library.

2013-04-04 17:45 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r199)
  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    + Implemented: GET PICTURE FUNCTION contain "K".
       Q 10,10 GET cText PICTURE "@!K"
       Now only those GETs will be presented having all text selected
       which will contain "K" in its picture function.

       The feature was missing since begining which get nailed today.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate "@K" usage.

2013-04-03 17:22 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r198)
  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Version bump.

2013-04-03 16:04 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r197)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + QREAD ... ATTRIBUTES <aAttrbs>
    + #define _QSET_EDITSPADDING
    + #command QSET EDITSPADDING [TO] <nPadds>

  * hbqtwidgets/getlist.prg
    + Added: ATTRIBUTES clause to QREAD : QREAD ... ATTRIBUTES <aAttrbs>
       <aAttrbs> is a two dimentional array. First element will be one
       of the following constants and the second its value:

          _QGET_ATTRB_SETMODE    { 25, 80 }  Defaults to NIL
          _QGET_ATTRB_RESIZABLE  .T. | .F.   Defaults to .T.

       _QGET_ATTRB_SETMODE will instruct the GET engine to resize the
       window per rows and columns as would a normal GT window does.

       _QGET_ATTRB_RESIZABLE will allow you to fine tune user behavior,
       as to if he/she can resize the form window.

       These two attributes are applied only in case if QREAD is
       called __WITHOUT__ <GetParent>, i.e., like Clipper GT.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: a title-bar-less modal dialog to host a HbQtBrowse()
       object mainly usable for lookup browsers. This has been achieved for
       Clipper like data-entry windows respecting
       <nTop>,<nLeft>,<nBottom>,<nRight> coordinates of TBrowse().

       You only need to pass <lOnTop> == TRUE to activate it as below:

          oBrowse := HbQtBrowseNew( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, oParent, oFont, lOnTop )
            =>
          oBrowse := HbQtBrowseNew( 10, 10, 20, 70, oDataEntryWindow, NIL, .T. )
          // Configure the browse, add columns, define various blocks, etc.
          oBrowse:execute()

       Terminating the browser will be initiated from oBrowse:navigationBlock()
       depending upon the application's needs as:
          IF nKey == K_ESC
             oBrowse:terminate()
          ELSEIF nKey == K_ENTER
             // Retieve the current record's info to be used elsewhere.
             oBrowse:terminate()
          ELSE ...

       In real-time scenario, like in Clipper, the complete sequence will be like:

          FUNCTION Main()

             SetKey( K_F2, {|| MySelectionBrowser() } )
             @ 12, 10 SAY "This" GET cText
             @ 13, 10 SAY "That" GET cOtherText

             READ
             SetKey( K_F2, NIL )

             RETURN NIL

          FUNCTION MySelectionBrowser()
             LOCAL oBrowse

             oBrowse := HbQtBrowseNew( 10, 10, 20, 70, GetActive():parent(), NIL, .T. )
             WITH OBJECT oBrowse
                // other blocks
                :navigationBlock := {|...| NavigateMe( ... ) }
             ENDWITH

             oBrowse:execute()

             RETURN NIL

          FUNCTION NavigateMe( nKey, , oBrowse )

             SWITCH nKey
             CASE K_ESC   ; oBrowse:terminate() ; RETURN .T.
             CASE K_ENTER ; // Pull Record Info */ ; oBrowse:terminate() ; RETURN .T.
             CASE ...
             ENDSWITCH

             RETURN .F.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/pureclip.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how a lookup browser can be implemented and used.
       Press F2 to activate lookup browser. If you will be inside first get,
       pressing ENTER on the lookup browser will put the value of second field
       of browser in the GET.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate the use of QREAD ... ATTRIBUTES

2013-03-31 03:54 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r196)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: METHOD searchExBlock( bBlock )
                   METHOD searchEx( cValue )
       When activated, a blue colored label will show up at the bottom
       of the browser displaying search string in white.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Added: METHOD indexKeyType() -> cType

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added code to demoonstrate how oHbQtBrowse:searchExBlock() works.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Implemented: searching feature in HbDBU as per above implementation.
       Now, if an index is active on the browser, then pressing any printable
       key will start an incremental search, pressing ENTER will terminate
       search, pressing K_BS will allow to alter the search string.

       This implementation is a non-blocking operation, means, all other
       features of the browser are still active while search is being
       performed. This facilitates to develop look-up browsers without which
       we cannot imagine to port our Clipper code.

    NEXT: HbQtBrowse to be encapsulated in a title-bar less modal dialog
          to present a truely look-up browsers taking use of the above
          search implementation, stay tuned.

  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented: support for drag-and-drop of source files onto

  * hbxbp/filedialog.prg
    ! A small omission corrected. Now default filename is shown in the
       <File:> editi control as selected.

  * hbide/selectsources.ui
    + Added: few more controls.

  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Refined: the Project Builder concept. Now no file dialog is opened
       to fetch the .hbp filename. Instead, <Select Sources> dialog
       shows up <.hbp> edit control and an icon next to it to select
       a folder. A default project file name starting with "prj" and
       ending with next number of "prjnnnnn.hbp" is shown in last
       explored working folder, like, <c:\myprojects\prj00001.hbp>.
       Next time if a project is created in same folder,
       <c:\myprojects\prj00002.hbp> will show up if prj00001.hbp is
       still lying there.

       The above feature was pointed out by Massimo.

2013-03-22 18:02 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r192)
  * hbide/projectpropertiesex.ui
  + hbide/selectsources.ui
  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    + Added: selectsources.ui

  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Implemented: restructured and re-thought of Project builder.

       1. The <Project Properties> dialog now contain only single view,
           all contained inside there and works as before except for
           interface.

       2. <Create a Project> action opens a file save dialog where you
           need to provide a .hbp name, which is tested for duplicacy
           and disregarded if exists a project with same name.
           Before this step was asking for the folder location only.

       3. A modal dialog is opened containing all the sources contained
           in the folder where above project resides. Sources are ordered
           first by extention and next by name. By default all sources
           are shown as checked, exception being .hbp, .hbc, .hbm.

       4. Interface provides to <Select/Unselect All>, <Select By Ext>,
           and <UnSelect by Ext> where you can manage which sources
           should makeup to the project.

       5. Interface also contain elements to provide few hbmk2 specifc
           switches plus compiler specific switches. I have not gone
           to unnecessary details, only switches which are frequently
           used are vailable on the interface. This interface is only
           available for a NEW project. Once saved, and re-called
           for changes, the old dialog with changes told in #1 above
           will be effective.

       6. Once satisfied with the selections and switches, click <OK>.
           The <Projects Properties> Dialog will show up displaying
           actual .hbp contents. Still project is not saved. It may
           be modified as per your additional requirements as you
           would do in a .hbp just like in a text-editor, i.e., adding
           more switches and/or sources from other folders, etc.

       7. Click <Save & Exit> or <Save> to save the project on disk.
           Such saved project can directly be submitted to hbmk2 from
           comman-line as well. The files and switches are organized
           in meaningful sections.

    ; NOTE: This implementation has made <Project> setup and link
            process a breeze. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

    ; NEXT: drag-drop support of sources in <Project Properties> dialog.

2013-03-21 13:45 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r191)
  * hbqtwidgets/getsys.prg
    + Implemented: @ ... QGET ... COMBOBOX ... to ::assign() the selected

       does not post validates the selection, simply assigns. Before it was
       done via presseing ENTER only which also post validates.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed: a wrong type checking which was preveting user defined
       context-menu block.

  + hbdbu/resources/hbdbu.htm
    + Added: HbDBU documentation in .html format.
       This documentation is made available by clicking on <Help> icon
       on the toolbar.

  + hbdbu/resources/help.png
    + New image for <Help> action on the HbDBU's toolbar.
  * hbdbu/dbu.qrc
    + Added help.png and hbdbu.htm.

  * hbdbu/dbu.ui
    + Added: one more page to stacked widget for a futuristic feature.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Implemented: help documentation via an icon <Help> on the HbDBU's toolbar.
       The documentation content is a work-in-progress as I am really poor
       in explaining an application. Anyway I will try my level best.
       If possible, you can send some text explaining any part of the HbDBU.

    % Changed: context menu options on a browser instance.
       It is now rationale will all important actions a user is ought to
       perform frequently. Speak-out if more actions should go there.

       It was a pending feature till now, but Massimo just pushed it up.

    % Changed a little the behavior of invoking HbDBU.
       If a .dbf is supplied on the command-line and no .dbu is supplied,
       then no environment will be read and saved by default. Anyhow,
       environment can be saved via <Save Environment> icon.

2013-03-14 16:14 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)(r188)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Made some methods and functions public.
    + Added: couple of more methods, internal usage.

  + hbdbu/resources/rest-env.png
  + hbdbu/resources/save-env.png
  * hbdbu/dbu.qrc
    + Added: two more images for HbDBU's toolbar.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Implemented: command-line parameters extended to accept the environment
       file ( .dbu ) to restore settings from.

    + Implemented: command-line parameters to accept default RDD to use
       for next .dbf files provided on the command-line.

    + Implemented: to memorize last RDD to make it default for next run.

    + Added: <Save Environment> icon on the toolbar.
       Activating it will open file save dialog asking for a .dbu, and if
       provided correctly, including the .dbu extention, will save the
       current environment into it, which can be opened and/or merged with
       your current session on will.

    + Added: <Merge Environment> icon on the toolbar.
       When invoked will ask for a .dbu in file open dialog. The environment
       contained therein will be merged into your existing environment.

    EXAMPLES:
       hbdbu.exe e:\dev_exes\ntx.dbu dbfntx e:\harbour\tests\test.dbf
         will open the test.dbf with DBFNTX driver.

       hbdbu.exe e:\dev_exes\ntx.dbu dbfntx e:\harbour\tests\test.dbf \
                                     dbfcdx e:\harbour\tests\test.dbf
         will open the test.dbf with DBFNTX drive and 2nd copy of test.dbf
         with DBFCDX rdd.

       hbdbu.exe e:\envs\mylastenv.dbu
         will open mylastenv.dbu contained view.

       hbdbu.exe e:\envs\mylastenv.dbu DBFCDX e:\harbour\tests\test.dbf
         will open the view in mylastenv.dbu and also test.dbf with DBFCDX rdd.

    NOTE: this implementation allows you to save and execute n number of views.
          Also this empowers you to link .dbf and .dbu's with HbDBU via explorer.

    % Refined: Functions Map layout.
       Now it shows out like this, publishing the call with arguments:

       Alert()(10)
            E:\harbour\addons\hbdbu\dbu.prg
            (  282) exit                  : Alert( "Exit HbDBU ?", { "Yes", "No" } )
            (  329) setDatabaseParams     : Alert( "Could not Connect to Cache Server" )
            (  429) saveMyTable           : Alert( { cTable + ", already exists!", "DO you want to overwrite it ?" }, { "No", "Yes" }, , , "WARNING : Table could be Overwritten" )
            (  448) saveMyTable           : Alert( cTable + " : has been created successfully!" )

       It helps to locate certain instances of wrongly passed arguments.

    + Added: functionsmap.ui

  * hbide/main.prg
    + Implemented: Printing option to <Show Code Fragment> window

       pages which, in turn, can be printed as per choice.

  * hbide/edit.prg
  * hbide/editor.prg
    + Implemented: printing of selected text.
       How It Works:
       ============
        1. Select the text by mouse or keyboard.
        2. Right-Click to activate context menu.
        3. Select <Show Selected Text>
        4. A stay-on-top code-fragment window will be opened
            containing the selected text.
        5. Press CTRL+P to activate print preview dialog.

  * hbide/actions.prg
  * hbide/docks.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/object.prg
    + Added: components to activate and manipulate feature
             IdeFunctionsMap() (Read Below).
             Will be referred as <Functions Map> in subsequent context.

  * hbide/findreplace.prg
    + Implemented: CLASS IdeFunctionsMap()
       <Functions Map> is a tool to view/print the functions usage
       given a .hbp project or a combinations of .hbp projects.

       It obtains a map of functions as:
         1. Where they are defined, with arguments, if possible.
         2. And from Where they are called, with source/function/line numbers.

       It empowers a developer to optimize his/her source code,
       to isolate functions which are never called, to determine
       why a function is called so many times in a single function
       or source, etc. Developers imagination is the limit as to
       how this tool can be used to his advantage.

       How It Works:
       ============
        1. Click on <Functions Map> icon on the main toolbar.
            Alternatively click <Main Menu><View><Docking Widgets><Functions Map>.
        2. A docking widget will appear on the right docking area.
        3. On the top, a selectable list of all projects visible in
            <Projects Tree> will appear.
        4. Select the projects for which to obtain Funtions Map.
        5. Click on <Create> push-button visible right under projects
            selection list.
        6. The stat will start appearing in the lower edit control.
        7. You can click on <Stop> push button anytime during the process.
        8. After all source files will be processed, real-time map entries
            will start appearing in the editor.
        9. Have patient, it may take some time, depending upon the project(s)
            size in terms of number of lines processed.
        10.Once the map is complete, scrolling entries will stop to appear,
            navigate the editor. Right-click context menu is avialble for
            further options.
        11.Double-clicking on a entry will open the relevant source,
            positioning the cursor on relevant portion of the line.

       The map is divided in two parts.
       1st part shows the functions which have been called at least once.
       2nd part shows only those functions which have never been called.
       It make it easier to investigate sources.

       These assumptions are relevant to this process:

       1. Functions called in macros do not makeup to the map.
       2. Function call is determined with this regular expression:
            "\b[A-Za-z0-9_]+ ?(?=\()"
          ( Please shout if it is wrong ).
       3. Commands are not parsed to functions and hence do not make up in map.
       4. Only CLASS declation is considered as function, methods are not
           taken into account.
       5. No seperation id made for STATIC and PUBLIC functions, both
           make up to the map.
       6. Multi-line, single-line, in-line ( only at the end with // and && ) remarks
           are left untouched.

       Layout of Mapped Entries:
       ========================
       Function contained the project(s) sources ( 1st Section ):

       DecryptPass( cStr, nMode )(6)                          Prototype, times called.
       (4)  E:\Laptop-Vouch32\dev_sources\qdbu\dbumisc.prg    Line#, Source Name             CLICKABLE
            E:\harbour\addons\hbdbu\dbu.prg                   Called-in Source
            (  362) openConnections( aConxns )                Line#, Function called from    CLICKABLE
            (  362) openConnections( aConxns )                .
            (  363) openConnections( aConxns )                .
            (  363) openConnections( aConxns )                .
            (  368) openConnections( aConxns )                .
            (  369) openConnections( aConxns )                .

       Function not contained in the sources but called ( 1st Section ):

       DbuMGR()(1)                                            Function w/out prototype, times called
            E:\harbour\addons\hbdbu\dbu.prg                   Called-in Source
            (   95) Main( ... )                               Line#, Function called from    CLICKABLE

       Function contained in the source(s) but not called ( 2nd Section ):

       Main( ... )                                            Prototype
       (85)  E:\harbour\addons\hbdbu\dbu.prg                  Line#, Source Name


       How the Feature was conceived:
       =============================
       The other day, my manager asked me if we have some utility which can be used
       to isolate those functions which are not being called any-more. The idea was
       to optimize the huge application developed constantly in-house since 23+ years,
       from Clipper to (x)Harbour. I posted the request on Harbour-devep list. Single
       reply from Tamas was difficult to use plus was not satisfying what I wanted.
       So, I thought, why not HbIDE should have this feature, and result is satisfying.

       Your opinion and suggestions will matter.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: METHOD activateIndexMenu()
                   METHOD activateColumnsMenu()
       As the name implies, calling these methods will activate the
       respective menu options on the HbQtBrowserr toolbar.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Added: code to exploit above two methods.

  + hbqtwidgets/resources/copy.png
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
    + Added: another image.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: selection of multiple rows and columns by dragging
       the mouse and then copy the selection on clipboard. A new
       icon "Copy Clipboard" is provided on the HbQtBrowse:toolbar
       to activate copy operation after selection. Alternatively,
       ALT+C key can be used to copy selection.

       The records are separated with hb_eol().
       The columns are separated by K_TAB.
       MS Excel, Notepad, HbIDE pastes this copy properly.

       The first row contains the column headers, so no need to
       remember the field names manually.

       NOTE: it has not been possible to scroll past the last row visible
             in the browser window for selection process. Columns
             can be scrolled till end.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Implemented: to open next browser at position where last browser
       was closed, if any. Only position is relevant, not size.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added dbucreate.prg

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Implemented: <Create a Table> action which can be activated via
       an icon on the HbDBU's top toolbar. A modeless, stay-on-top window
       is displayed. Window is devided into two sections. Top one hosts an
       array browser to fetch table structure. Lower one host another array
       browser to fetch index tags and expression.

       These are the actions available for editing, etc.

       K_F1        to view these instructions

       K_ENTER     to start editing

       K_CTRL_INS  to insert a blank row
       K_CTRL_DEL  to delete current row
       K_CTRL_UP   to move current row up
       K_CTRL_DOWN to move current row down

       K_CTRL_V    to paste copied structure ( from Structure pane at the right of HbDBU )

       K_CTRL_P    to print the structure info

       initiating editing will always position the cursor on "Name" field and then will
       continue circulatory as Name->Type->Len->Dec->NextRow->... A new row will
       automatically appened at the bottom if "Dec" field is reached and current
       row is the last one. To leave the editing mode, just press ESC. If "Name"
       field will be blank, the row will be deleted, browser will be refreshed.
       "Len" and "Dec" fields are auto assigned for (L)ogical and (D)ate fields.

       If required you can paste entire structure of an opened table. Click on the
       browser window whose structure is nneded to be pasted, click on <Structure>
       browser on the right-most pane, press CTRL+C, resturn back to <Create a Table>
       window, press CTRL+V, and see structure pasted here. The existing structure
       will be replaced so be carefull.

       Window is modeless so it is possible to start creating tables in multiple
       windows simultaneously.

       I am familiar with only DBFCDX and ADS (CDX) file types only. Let me know if
       anything is missing.

       This implementation also demnstrate an example how a parent/child relational
       form can be developed, like an invoice. This code has all the constructs
       in-place to achieve that, so strech your imagination in this direction.
       The complete code is contained in dbucreate.prg only, study it.

    + Implemented: ::nextEditor() and ::previousEditor() methods.
       Assigned: Alt+Right Arrow to ::nextEditor()
                 Alt+Left Arrow to ::previousEditor()
         The assigment is permanent. You can assign these methods
         to other keys but these keys cannot be overriden.

         The methods navigate right or left editing instance in a
         cirriculatory manner, means jumping to first or last editing
         tab depending upon the arrow hit.

         This enables to you navigate between tabs without leaving the
         keyboard. Till now you had to click on a tab to activate
         contained editing instance.

         The pointer was received from Francesco Saverio Giudice.

  * hbide/shortcuts.prg

2013-02-18 14:13 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_misc.prg
    + Implemented: in error handler, to find a child of the name
       representing the error message. Now, manually built dialogs
       have the same feature as Qt Creator created dialogs.

         oMain:cChildName -> object represented by cChildName.

       The limitation in this approach is that you must have to
       set the name in upper case.

       This implementation is made possible on top of oObj:findChild() method.
       Now you can construct a dialog and its children and then pass
       only main window object to functions which can then access
       its children transparently.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: setObjectName( "TBROWSE" ) suffixed with next counter,
       Just in case one wants to find it as oMain:TBrowse.

2013-02-15 18:53 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: SET/GET Method :pressHeaderBlock().
       The block is executed whenever user clicks on any column header
       and passes <nCol>,<cName>,<oBrw> arguments.

    % Changed: :verticalMovementBlock() passes the K_ constant associated
       with the movement, i.e., K_UP,K_DOWN,K_PGUP, K_PGDN, K_CTRL_PGUP,
       K_CTRL_PGDN instead of 0 to 5.

    + :verticalMovementBlock() is also executed when :configure() is called
        on browser and passes -3 as first argument.

    % Restructured and rewritten code to handle initial showing of
       browser object. This fixes the long-standing glich where
       browser rows were not displayed according to the height of the
       viewport.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Demonstrated: the use of :pressHeaderBlock().
       Clicking on the "Last Name" column header sets the index to "Last".
       Clicking on any other header set index to natural order.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: HbQtBrowse:refreshWindow() method which can be
       called with a connect to an event. The primary function of this
       method is to recalculate the viewport area and set the number of
       browser rows accordingly to reclaim the unoccupied area,
       which at certain circumstances is not available when browser
       is visible first time.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg

    + Added: one more image.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    % Code formatting.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    % Code cleanup.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    + Added: FUNCTION HbQtGetAt( nGlobalX, nGlobalY, cVar, cPic, cColor, bValid ) -> cVar | NIL
       The function fetches a single GET at global <nGlobalX>,<nGlobalY>
       screen coordinates inside a transparent modal dialog. WHEN clause
       is omitted because appln will call this function on a GET which has
       to be fetched actually.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: SET/GET METHODE verticalMovementBlock( bBlock ).
       The method is a callback reporting to appln when an actual vertical
       movement occurs. By actual movement means if no hittop/hitbottom
       is reached. The method was necessary to implement <LINKED TABLES>
       protocol implemented in HbDBU (Read Below).

        oBrowse:verticalMovementBlock := {|nMode,p2,oBrw| ::updateLinks( nMode, p2, oBrw ) }
          <nMode> == 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 ( Will document later ).
          <p2>    == NIL
          <oBrw>  == Reporting Browse Object

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Added: credits to my employers, Curacao, for supporting this project.

    ! Fixed: few errors reported on the list.
    % Optimized: code offered on the list.
    + Implemented: <Linked Tables> protocol. In Clipper language
       relational tables. N number of tables can be nested
       to build a complex relational hirarchy (parent/child/grandchild).

       How it Works:

       1. Open some tables on a HbDBU panel, organize them with positioning and sizing.
       2. Set the appropriate indexes.
       3. Close HbDBU to save these settings, just-in-case.
       4. Click on the <Link> icon on HbDBU's toolbar.
       5. A dialog will appear with a list of aliases open on the current panel.
       6. Drag and drop the aliases over to its desired parent. This can be done in
          any combination, viz., parent
                                   child_1
                                     grandchild_1_1
                                   child_2
                                   child_3
                                     grandchild_3_1
                                 parent_2
                                 ...
       7. Once satisfied, what would you like to see, close HbDBU and run again,
          just-in-case.  Do not worry, your session is saved.
       8. Double-click on <Link Expression> column of an alias, a GET will open-up.
       9. Press F2 which will open a list of fields of its parent alias.
       10.Double-click on a field, which will be inserted at the current
          cursor position. Build appropriate and valid expression matching
          with its current index expression.
       11.Note that you won't be able to leave the GET until expression is
          syntactically valid. No check is performed for the type of returned
          value of expression evaluation. The reason is that the links map
          building is independent of current index, which could be set
          at later time.
       12.Press <OK> button to activate the links. If you have appropriate indexes
          already set, the browsers will instantly reflect the linked data only.
          Any vertical movement in the parent browser will refresh the child browsers.
       13.Now a step advanced: uncheck the checkbox at the left of some child,
          the child browser will stop to be refreshed. Old link-expression
          will stay though. (This is subject to change, I am thinking).
       14.Close HbDBU, run it again, click on the <Lin> icon, click on <OK>
          to activate the links.

       ;  Hopefully you will offer some advice.

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Fully functional and usable HbDBU. A different experience!

  ; WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN HbDBU - A BRIEF OVERVIEW

         COMPONENT
    * All components are completely configurable on application level.
    * Multiple Panels to spread browsers.
    * Allows opening same table n number of times.
    * Allows opening same table on any panel.
    * Allows index manipulation on browser level.

         APPLICATION
    * Splash screen.
    * About HbDBU.
    * Shows how to pull information about HbDBU's various components
       and save them and then how to retrieve and populate them
       back on next run. These are :
        1. Tables Tree structure.
        2. Created Panels.
        3. Opened tables with index order, record number, column position,
            contained columns, columns order.
    * Implements almost all database actions, viz.,
        1. Edit a field.
        2. Edit a record.
        3. Delete a record.
        4. Append new record.
        5. Set and Clear a scope.
        6. Set and clear a filter.
        7. Seek, soft-seek, seek-last.
        8. Find in Field.
        9. Lock/Unlock a current/selective record.
        10.List of locked records.
    * Editing is implemented as:
        1. Edit only current cell.
        2. Edit row cell-by-cell.
        3. Edit cell row-by-row.

    * Remembers exact state of last run including entries in
       Tables Tree, created panels, opened tables with exact views.

       per Clipper documentation.

    + Added: function FUNCTION HbQtMsgBox( cMsg, cTitle ).
       Scheduled to be enhanced.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    * Enhanced: function __hbqtGetNextIdAsString( cString ).

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    -+ Replaced: Index ComboBox and JumpToColumn comboBox with drop-down menu
        embedded toolbuttons. It occupies less horizontal space plus offers
        better toolbar look.

    + Added: toolbar icons <Add a Column> and <Delete Current Column>
       <Delete Current Column> is straight forward. Clicking on it will delete
        the current highlighted column off the browser view.
       <Add a Column> needs :addColumnsBlock to be supplied by the
        application which will be responsible to populate <Add Columns Menu>
        as well as inserting a properly configured column based on the
        selection of field name from drop down menu. For example:

          oHbQtBrowse:addColumnsBlock := {| nMode, cColumn, oBrowse | AddMyColumn( nMode, cColumn, oBrowse ) }

        The block is evaluated with nMode == 0 once when user clicks on the
        <Add Columns Icon> first time which requests the appln to supply
        the names of the columns or fields and populates the drop down menu with them.

        The block is called with mode == 1 when user activates a prompt
        of drop-down menu. <cColumn> contains the name of the activated propmt.
        It is the responsibility of the application to insert a column depending
        on the <cColumn> value.

        Please study the implementation code inside tests/browdb.prg.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: Code to demonstrate the usage of :addColumnsBlock.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: :showIndicator( cRgbColorString )
       Places a 2 pixel high line with <cRgbColorString> on top of the
       browser window. This facilitates the place a warning system on the
       tables having utmost sensivity.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Made public some attributes of the MdiBrowser, i.e., :connection(), :driver().

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Added code to show a RED line on top of the browser if a table is opened
       via a specific connection.

    + Initial commit of HbDBU.
       Just play with this toy. Do not initiate embedding HbQtDbu()
       in your applications as refinement in internal architect is
       on the cards. Some details are scheduled to be changed.

    ; Note that the HbDBU contains all elements which I am employing
       for our in-production implementation but guarded against the
       directives. You can unfold them as you deem fit. The real-time
       usage is always preferred to expose the full functionality
       than a reduced demo application, so hope that you will bear
       with me.

       The detailed documentation will follow after internal architect
       will reach my satisfaction level. Next couple of weeks I am
       onto this only.

       If you deem appropriate, extend your opinions and experiences
       of any DBU you had been living with. Hopefully maximum will
       make-up inside HbDBU.

    ; Enjoy with the multi-platform compliant HbDBU.

    + Added: Class HbQtToolbar() and HbQtDbu().
       The last week has been so hectic but results are very fruitful.
       HbQtDbu() is a COM like implementation of GUI Database Manager
       which can be embedded into any application. All its components
       are fully configurable. A detailed overview and a usable and
       expandable application will be committed in a couple of days.

    ; You will really relish this implementation.

    + Fixed: flickering of windows when <Search> was initiated.
    + Added: <Help> icon on the toolbar.
    + Started: implementation of displaying appln supplied help info
       in an integrated way. Currently Alert() is being used but
       is scheduled to be presented in a meaningful way. Complete
       documentation will follow after it reaches a satisfactory level.

       This hides the <toColumn> combobox on the browser toolbar.
    + Added: ACCESS|ASSIGN MESSAGE printingEnabled( lEnabled )
       This hides the <Print> toolbar button.

    ; NOTE: the above switches are operational on toolbar actions.
       From withing application all actions are available.

    % Rearranged: toolbar icons sequence. Now it is more usable.

2013-01-09 18:47 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtevent.prg
    + Added: function __hbqtKeyboard( <ncKey>, [<oWidget>] )
       Posts <ncKey> into <oWidget>'s event queue.
       <oWidget> defaults to QApplication():focusWidget().
        The function provides a convinient mechanism to initiate another
        action from with current action after returning from current
        action. This protocol is the backbone of any GUI application.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: public method :widget() which returns the main component
       of browser and can be used to post events. This is :oTableView in HbQtBrowse().

    + Added: ACESS/ASSIGN METHOD searchText( <cSearchText> ).
       This displays <cSearchText> at the right side of statusbar
       of browser widget. this is a convinient method to avoid creation of
       widget to display user-input. ( Read below ).

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how INCREMENTAL search can be terminated from
       withing appln :navigationBlock.

    + Added: code to demonstrate how an incremental search can be performed
       taking use of oBrowse:searchText() method and how to take other actions
       while still in incremental search.

  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: class constructor from "NEW" to "INIT".
       This is in-line with Class(y) compatibility and will be useful
       when Przemek will implement true objects in Harbour.
       Though it will not be necessary at this moment, but still
       re-build everything.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Fixed: wrong implemention of sending :selectAll() to QLineEdit.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    % Experimented: but failed, code still resides.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    - Deactivated: moving the columns with mouse. Will come to it later.
    + Added: <Stop> browser toolbar icon adjoining <Scroll>.
       The icon remains in disabled state until a <Scroll> is initiated.
       Once clicked, its state is again disabled.

    % Removed: the <Stop> button appearing at the bottom row after <Scroll>
       is initiated. Now toolbar icon <Stop> is enabled instead.

      <Scroll> event is now terminated if any other event is initiated.
      This is necessary to avoid multiple initializations leading to
      weired behavior.

    + Enhanced: oBrowse:editCell( cPicture, cColor, bWhen, bValid, nKey )
       <nKey> is the key you would like to stuff in the edit buffer.
       This implementation respects "@K" function of <cPicture> parameter
       or oColumn:picture clause is <cPicture> is not passed to :editCell().

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how "@K " in oBrowse:editCell() can be exploited.

  + hbqtwidgets/scroll.ui
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: scroll.ui - Widget to fetch user options for a scroll.

  + hbqtwidgets/resources/scroll.png
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
    + Added: scroll.png.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    % :selectAll() was wrongly called on other type of GET then QLineEdit.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: appln callable method :scroll( [<nMode>], [<nMSInterval>] )
             Interface icon <Scroll> on the browser toolbar which call :scroll().

       This is a convinient mechanism to to present table with auto
       scroll option where data is refreshed in a fixed interval. It is a
       most useful function for upper management to provide a dash-board
       like functionality.

       If :scroll() is called without any parameter, then a dialog to
       fetch user options is presented, otherwise scroll is initiated
       immediately.

       <nMode> has three possible values:
       1. Scroll down-bottom-top-down - scrolling starts from current record,
           when :hitBottom is detected, jumps to top of the browser and starts
           scrolling downwards.
       2. Scroll down-bottom - scrolling starts from current record and keeps
           on downward. It does not check if :hitBottom is reached or not.
           Useful when user needs what latest records are being pushed into
           the table.
       3. Sctoll to bottom of browser and issues :goBottom() always.
           Useful when user needs to review the latest info.

       A <Stop> push button stays in the bottom row+ location to stop the scrolling.

    % Renamed: HbQtGetSome(...) => HbQtBulkGet(...)
    + Added: treating the GET in a combobox if one of the elements of
       HbQtBulkGet()'s <xVariable> is an array of character strings. The
       RETURN value will be a string of choice selected in combobox. the
       first prompt in such array will be the default option when combo
       is presented.

       Thanks to Angel Pais for the idea.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg

2013-01-03 13:50 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: HBQTBRW_* constants, usable to configure HbQtBrowse interface.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    + Implemented: Function
       HbQtGetSome( <xVariable>, [<xCaption>], [<xPicture>], [<xWhen>], [<xValid>], [<cTitle>] ) -> <xVariable>

       A general purpose function to fetch values of one or many GETS in a modal dialog.

       <xVariable> an array of variables or a single variable to GET.

                   If <xVariable> is an array of variables then all the following
                   parameters must be an array of attributes matching the length of
                   <xVariables>. Function does not check for the number of array indexes.

       <xCaption>  variable(s)|Literal(s) describing the GET. Defaults to "Variable_" + hb_ntos( nIndex ).
       <xPicture>  variable(s)|Literal(s) of PICTURE templates. Defaults to "".
       <xWhen>     block(s) to supply for :preValidate. Defaults to {|| .T. }.
       <xValid>    block(s) to supply for :postValidate. Defaults to {|| .T. }.

       <cTitle>    Title to display on GETs dialog's titlebar. Defaults to "Enter Some Values!".

       RETURNS     <xVariable> in the form they are supplied to the function. If ESCape is
                   pressed then original values supplied to the function are returned.

                   GETs dialog is centered on the window which has focus at the time of
                   calling this function.

       NOTE:       Name of the function may be changed. If you have a better name, please forward.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: <GoTo> icon on the browser's toolbar to navigate to a designated record.
    + Implemented: ACCESS/ASSIGN method :gotoBlock  to execute :goto() method, either via
       appln call or activating it via toolbar icon <Goto>. Interface just exposes the
       visual elements to inform the appln about user interaction. The actual navigation
       is performed at the appln level only. How...

         Appln: oBrowse:gotoBlock := {|| GotoMyRecord() }
         User:  Clicks on the <Goto> icon. :gotoBlock is evaluated.
         Appln:
           STATIC FUNCTION GotoMyRecord()
           LOCAL nRec, nPRec := RecNo()
           IF ( nRec := HbQtGetSome( nPRec, "Record Number", , , , "GoTo ?" ) ) > 0
              dbGoto( nRec )
           ELSE
             RETURN .F.
           ENDIF
           RETURN nPRec != nRec

       If the :gotoBlock returns TRUE, the browser is refreshed, otherwise not.

    + Added: <Indexes> combobox on the browser's toolbar to change the index order.
    + Implemented: ACCESS/ASSIGN method :indexes. This accepts an array of index information as:

        AAdd( aIndexes, { "Natural Order", {|oBrw| dbSetOrder( 0 ), oBrw:refreshAll(), oBrw:forceStable() } } )
        AAdd( aIndexes, { "Last Name"    , {|oBrw| dbSetOrder( 1 ), oBrw:refreshAll(), oBrw:forceStable() } } )
        oBrowse:indexes := { aIndexes, 2 }

        First element of <aIndexes> is used to populate the <Indexes> combobox.
        Second element is a codeblock which will be executed when an option in combobox
          is activated.
        Second element of :indexes ASSIGNed array is used to activate <Indexes> combobox.

        <Indexes> combobox is viaible only if appln has supplied :indexes information.

        This is a convenient mechanism to armour the end user with many more options.

    % ReImplemented <Search> option. Please discard the previous documentation.
       This new implementation empowers you with executing an incremental search,
       a search within the unindexed field and much more. How...

        Appln: oBrowse:searchBlock := {|xValue,nMode,oBrw| LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw ) }
                                         ->
                                      { [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> }

        Appln: Inside :navigationBlock - :search( [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> )
        Interface: <Search> icon - :search()

        METHOD Search( [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> )
          If [<xValue>] == NIL, :searchBlock will be called to obtain <Search> info as:
            IF HB_ISBLOCK( ::searchBlock )
               aInfo := Eval( ::searchBlock, NIL, NIL, Self )
            ENDIF

          It will be the responsibility of the appln to supply info regarding what to fetch
          and how to respond to search creteria. If appln does not return back an array of
          3 elements, viz., 1. What to search as a variable of type CDNL, viz.,
          space( 30 ), 0, or whatever, and mode of search (read below), then these three values
          defaults to : 1. the value returned by Eval( ::getColumn( ::colPos ):block )
                        2. ::getColumn( ::colPos ):picture
                        3. HBQTBRW_SEARCH_ONCE
                             Other options:
                           HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL
                           HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
          depending upon the above three values, interface exposes a modal GET at the
          last+ row of the browser window to fetch <Search> value, initially set with
          value of <xValue>.

          The next action is carried out in accordance with <nMode>:
          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_ONCE
            Dialog to fetch value is closed, :serachBlock is evaluated again with modified
            <xValue>, <nMode> and <Self>. Appln takes appropriate action. Typicaly,
            appln will invoke this mode if an index is active.

          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL
            Dialog to fetch serach value stays, with every change in the GET value,
            :serachBlock is evaluated with modified <xValue>, <nMode> and <Self>.
            Appln takes appropriate action. Dialog to fetch search value stays until
            RETURN is pressed which mark the end of the <Search> event. For the duration
            of search, browser cursor is changed to ROW mode. Typicaly,
            appln will invoke this mode if an index is active.

          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
            Dialog to fetch value is closed. A timer event is started inside the interface
            at a 10 ms interval, which calls :searchBlock as usual. Then :searchBlock is
            expected to return TRUE or FALSE to flag that <Search> is found or not. If NOT,
            then browser is moved down by one row. If YES or :hitBottom is detected then
            <Serach> event is terminated. Appln can detect <ESC> press in the :navigationBlock,
            and can terminate the <Search> accordingly (study example below).

          In case of nMode == INCREMENTAL, after <Search> event is terminated,
            :searchBlock is once again evaluated with no parameters. This is useful
            to implement a lookup browser.

          Here is a minimum useful example, you can extend it to extreme:

          STATIC nLastKey := 0

          FUNCTION Main()
             LOCAL oBrowse := ...

             oBrowse:searchBlock     := {|xValue,nMode,oBrw| LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw ) }
             oBrowse:navigationBlock := {|nKey,xData,oBrw|  HandleMyOptions( nKey,xData,oBrw ) }

             RETURN NIL

          STATIC FUNCTION HandleMyOptions( nKey,xData,oBrowse )
             LOCAL xResult, i
             LOCAL lHandelled := .T.

             nLastKey := nKey
             ...

             RETURN .t.

          STATIC FUNCTION LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw )
             LOCAL nRec

             IF xValue == NIL .AND. oBrw == NIL
                /* search is finished, take other action, this will help to build a selectable browser */
                Alert( "Current Record Number Is : " + hb_ntos( RecNo() ) )

             ELSEIF xValue == NIL                           /* Interface is requesting to initiate search */
                IF IndexOrd() == 1
                   RETURN { Space( Len( TEST->last ) ), NIL, HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL }
                ELSE
                   RETURN { NIL, NIL, HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD }
                ENDIF

             ELSE
                IF IndexOrd() == 1                          /* Interface is requesting to do the search as per needs */
                   nRec := RecNo()
                   IF ! dbSeek( Trim( xValue ) )
                      dbGoto( nRec )
                   ELSE
                      oBrw:refreshAll()
                   ENDIF
                ELSEIF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
                   IF nLastKey == K_ESC
                      nLastKey := 0
                      RETURN .T.
                   ENDIF
                   RETURN Eval( oBrw:getColumn( oBrw:colPos ):block ) = xValue

                ENDIF

             ENDIF

             RETURN .T.

      the whole application, which had a drawback to not show-up if multiple
      GET screens were floated at once. Also the visiblility of focus frame
      is controllable by QREAD clause NOFOCUSFRAME.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: in-place cell editing with PICTURE, COLOR, WHEN, VALID clauses.
       This is in addition to record editing in a separate adjoining dialog which
       is called by application as oBrw:edit(...) or by clicking on the <Edit>
       icon of browser toolbar.

       On the contrary, Cell editing is only callable by the application. This
       can be called as :

         oBrw:editCell( [<cPicture>], [<cColor>], [<bWhen>], [<bValid>] ) -> xModifiedValue
           <cPicture> Defaults to oColumn:picture.
           <cColor>   Defaults to "N/BG*"
           <bWhen>    Defaults to oColumn:preBlock
           <bValid>   Defaults to oColumn:postBlock

       How it works;

          ...
          oBrw:navigationBlock( {|...| NavigateMe(...) } )
          ...

          FUNCTION NavigateMe( nKey...)
             SWITCH nKey
             CASE K_SH_F12
                xModifiedValue := oBrw:editCell()
                IF xModifiedValue != NIL  /* In Case ESC is Pressed */
                   // Save xModifiedValue at appropriate container.
                ENDIF
             ENDSWITCH

         The above is the minimum required. If :editCell() is called without
         supplying any arguments, then defaults are applied to GET the value.
         If ESCape is pressed on the GET then NIL is returned. In that case
         appln can take the appropriate action.

         Current highlighted cell is subject to :cellEdit() call.
         oColumn:block with <xModifiedValue> is __ALWAYS__ called when
         RETURN is pressed on GET and is postValidated.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
    + Added code to demonstrate how to use cell editing.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: following CASE statement in navigation SWITCH:

         CASE nKey == K_SH_F12
            IF dbRLock()
               oBrowse:panHome()
               oBrowse:Right()
               FOR i := 2 TO oBrowse:colCount()
                  xResult := oBrowse:editCell()  /* HbQt Entention */
                  IF xResult == NIL
                     EXIT                        /* ESCape is pressed */
                  ENDIF
                  SWITCH oBrowse:getColumn( i ):heading
                  CASE "Last Name"  ; REPLACE TEST->last     WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "First Name" ; REPLACE TEST->first    WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Salary"     ; REPLACE TEST->Salary   WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "HireDate"   ; REPLACE TEST->HireDate WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Age"        ; REPLACE TEST->Age      WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "City"       ; REPLACE TEST->City     WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "State"      ; REPLACE TEST->State    WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Zip"        ; REPLACE TEST->Zip      WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Notes"      ; REPLACE TEST->Notes    WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  ENDSWITCH
                  oBrowse:refreshCurrent()
                  IF i < oBrowse:colCount()
                     oBrowse:Right()
                  ENDIF
               NEXT
               IF xResult != NIL
                  dbCommit()
               ENDIF
               dbRUnlock()
            ENDIF
         OTHERWISE

    ; This demonstrate the exact usage one might had employed in Clipper
      application to fetch data entry in a browser. In any real-world
      senario, ground is ready to be exploited. Now I can dream of porting
      my Harbour simulated console/GUI applns to HbQt.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: Browser Printing. How...

       Activation:
         Application code - oBrw:print( cPrinter, lOpenPrintDialog )
         Interface        - <Print> icon on the browser toolbar

       After Activation:
         Looks for oBrw:title. If a value is found, then it is interpreted as
           SWITCH valtype( ::title )
           CASE "C"
              aTitle := hb_aTokens( ::title, ";" ) - Just like Alert().
           CASE ""A"
              aTitle := ::title
           CASE "B"
              aTitle := Eval( ::title, NIL, NIL, oBrw )
              Again <aTitle> is tested for string or array, and treated as above.
           ENDSWITCH
         <aTitle> defaults to { "Browsed Data" }
         <aTitle> is then printed on top of each page printed.
         First 5 Lines are significant. If more are supplied, those are ignored.

         Next line after <aTitle> is done with is :
           DtoC( Date() ) + " " + Time() + " " + "Page:" + hb_ntos( #pageNo )

         Next follow Headers Line.

         Then follows the actual data.

         Columns are printed exactly as seen in the browser, with same font,
         picture and colors. So it gives a WYSIWYG look. Most of the time printed
         output is pleasing.

         The only those columns, counted from left, make up to the printed output
         as many fit into the page width for printer in question. To start with
         PORTRAIT mode is selected, but you can always get LANDSCAPE output
         from the PREVIEWER dialog. More columns then will be automatically
         accomodated.

         I found a nasty bug, apparently in Qt itself, as follows:
         If QPrintDialog is executed, either inside browse code, or inside
         previwer window, application GPFs. So far I have not found a solution
         what is happening. It may be due that my laptop is not actively
         connected to a printer and hence Qt has some issues there. Later
         I will revisit the code in my office to get more clues. Till
         then...

         If you find motivation to debug, please uncomment some code in
         hbqtbrowse.prg and recompile yourself. If you find any solution,
         please report me back.

    + Added: how to SEARCH implementation. Missed from previous.

2012-12-25 15:40 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Version bump.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqabstractitemmodel.cpp
    ! Minor.

  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
  + hbqtwidgets/resources/*.png
    + Resource Images.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: hbqtwidgets.qrc

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: __hbqtImage( cPngWithoutExt )
       The function can be used in appln also to obtain many
       common usage images. This may eliminate the need to have
       application local images. Hopefully will reduce the burden
       on application part.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Changed: :editBlock's parameters.
       oBrw:editBlock := {| oBrw, aOrg, aMod, aCap | ... }
         =>
       oBrw:editBlock := {| aMod, {aOrg,aCap}, oBrw | ... }

       It is in accordance with decided protocol where any application
       supplied codeBlock, implemented over and above TBrowse blocks,
       will be fired with three parameters. First parameter will represent
       the most expected return value, 2nd will contain any additional
       data important and ancilliary to the 1st param, and 3rd will
       always be browse object in evaluating the block.

    % Changed: method :openEditor(...) => edit(...)
               method :edit() => editCell()
                 Confirms to general common sense.

    + Implemented: ToolBar on top of the browser window.
       Toolbar can be toggled to be displayed/hidden. Toolbar contains common
       actions a user always expect off a GUI browser, viz.,

         Edit | Print | Search | GoTop | Up | Down | GoBottom | PanHome | Left |
         Right | PanEnd | ComboToColumn | MoveFirst | MoveLeft | MoveRight | MoveLast

       Toggling the display of toolbar is controlled via ACCESS | ASSIGN method :toolbar.

         oBrw:toolbar := ! oBrw:toolbar

       By default ToolBar is hidden.

       <Print> option is not active yet.

    + Implemented: activation/execution of context menu. This is controlled as:

         oBrw:contextMenuBlock := {| oPos, NIL, oBrw | ... }

       When context menu request is detected, HbQtBrowse will look for :contextMenuBlock,
       and if found, will evaluate it with global mouse position (QPoint) as 1st param,
       NIL as 2nd, and Self as 3rd. It will be the responsibility of appln to respond
       to this event.

       And if :contextMenuBlock will not be supplied by the appln, a default context
       menu will be executed with some of the actions available on the toolbar.

    + Implemented: StatusBar at the bottom of the browse window.
       Again it is controlled by application, like:

         oBrw:statusbar := .T.
           OR
         oBrw:statusbar := ! oBrw:statusbar

       To display message on the StatusBar:

         oBrw:statusMessage := cMessage

       To clear the StatusBar:

         oBrw:statusMessage := ""

       By default ToolBar is hidden.

    + Implemented: SEARCH feature, interface and building blocks only.
       Application will take responsibility to carry on the search operation.
       HbQtBrowser merely provides the interface to communicate between browser
       interface and application code. How ...

       1. Appln will post a block as:

            oBrw:searchBlock := {|xSearch, nColPos, oBrw| ... }

       2. The SEARCH event could be started either by browser interface or
          application inside :navigationBlock.

          Interface: Click on the <Search> toolbar button.
          Application: calling oBrw:search( xValue ).

          In both instances, a single GET in a modal window will be presented.
          If appln has initiated the SEARCH, and has provided <xValue> in
          :search( xValue ) call, then this variable is GET. If click on
          <Search> icon has initiated it, or <xValue> == NIL, then the
          value contained in current hilighted cell of browser will be GET.
          In the latter case, column's PICTURE is also applied to it.
          GET will terminate on RETURN press, and searchBlock will be evaluated
          with GET value as 1st param. From here it is the responsibility of
          the appln to perform the actual search.

          The demo code is included in tests/browser.prg and test/browdb.prg.
          browser.prg addresses it for an array, while browdb.prg on a table.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate above features.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: clause LASTGETBLOCK <lastGetBlock>
       With this QREAD command looks as:

       #command QREAD [ [ PARENT ] <GetParent> ] ;
                      [ FONT <oFont>           ] ;
                      [ LINESPACING <nSpc>     ] ;
                      [ TITLE <title>          ] ;
                      [ ICON <icon>            ] ;
                      [<nomodal:NOMODAL>       ] ;
                      [ PROPERTIES <prop>      ] ;
                      [ LASTGETBLOCK <bLast>   ] ;
                            => ;
             HbQtReadGets( @GetList, SayList, <GetParent>, <oFont>, <nSpc>, ;
                           <title>, <icon>, <.nomodal.>, <{prop}>, <{bLast}> )

       ; Read below.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: method lastGetBlock( bBlock ) SETGET
       Placeholder to hold <lastGetBlock> of QREAD.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    + Implemented: to detect if GET in focus is the last GET in current GetList,
                   and if yes, then fire the <lastGetObject> block. The check
                   is performed in :postValidate() method.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: browser row editor honoring the :preBlock, :postBlock, :picture
       properties of columns. Thanks to QGET/QREAD of HbQt which made it possible
       to happen. The whole process is application controlled as per the true spirit
       of TBrowse. The following methods are exposed to the application:

         :editBlock( bBlock ) GETSET
            The block is responsible to "SAVE" data collected with editor widget.
            If no :editBlock is specifed, a simple oColumn:block is evaluated
            with modified data as its only parameter.
            :editBlock has to be defined as:

            oBrowse:editBlock := {|oBrw, aOriginal, aModified, aCaptions|  ;
                                      SaveMyData( oBrw, aOriginal, aModified, aCaptions ) }

            at the minimum. Application may pass other parameters to the "SAVE"
            function as appropriate. Here is brief description of 4 parameters:

            <oBrw>      No need to explain, it is oBrowse in question.
            <aOriginal> Array holding original values of the columns before "SAVE"
                        is requested. It is sent to facilitate better control
                        on determining what needs to be saved in real.
            <aModified> Array holding modified values of the columns.
            <aCaptions> Array holding <oColumn:heading> property. This facilitates
                        to recognize which data item needs to be updated.

            NOTE: Tbrowse does not know anything about the data source. Also columns
                  in a browse can be ordered to any position. So it is difficult
                  to guess where a modified value needs be saved. Here comes the
                  importance of <oColumn:heading>. I believe, you all must be
                  providing unique headings to columns, and if not, please set
                  your code right to grab the power of GUI editing.

         :openEditor( cTitle, lSaveOnLastGet, lDownAfterSave )
            The method needs to be called by the application, generally detecing
            an event in :navigationBlock, but may be by other means also. This opens
            a modal dialog adjoining the right edge of browser viewport. Editor will
            display <cTitle> in the title-bar. The position and size will be saved
            for current session of underlying browser. Next invocation will position
            it at last closing coordinates. Edotor is composed of a scrollable
            QFormLayout based form containing the GETs of columns data. At the bottom
            are 5 buttons with corresponding accelerator keys. Focus will be
            positioned on the first GET ( column ). Navigation of the GETs is
            per Harbour standards. WHEN, VALID and PICTURE instance variables are
            applied over the GETs.

            When last GET is hit by ENTER, <lSaveOnLastGet> [Defaults to TRUE], will
            be examined. If TRUE, the <lastGetBlock> is fired with 4 parameters, i.e.,
            <oBrw><aOriginal><aModified><aCaptions>. A LOGICAL is expected as the
            return value of the <lastGetBlock>. If it is TRUE, no further action is
            taken. If FALSE, <oColumn:block> is fired with modified value as parameter.

            Then <lDownAfterSave> [Defaults to TRUE] is examined. If TRUE, the browser
            is moved with :down(), column values are gathered, GETs are populated
            with new row value. The process goes on until user closes the Editor.
            Editor can be closed either by ESCAPing or clicking on X button.

            The bottom area buttons offer following functionality:

            <Save> <ALT+S        > Triggers "SAVE" action as described above.
            <Down> <ALT+DownArrow> Moves the browser :down() and refresh the GETs.
            <Up>   <ALT+UpArrow  > Moves the browser :up() and refresh the GETs.
            <Btm>  <ALT+PageDown > Moves the browser :goBottom() and refresh the GETs.
            <Top>  <ALT+PageUp   > Moves the browser :goTop() and refresh the GETs.

            The design and layout of the EDITOR is not yet final and may undergo
            needed changes as per user inputs.

          Displays the vertical scroolbar to navigate the database/array.
          To use it effectively you need to define following blocks [with example]:

            oBrowse:firstPosBlock       := {| | 1                }
            oBrowse:lastPosBlock        := {| | LastRec()        }

            No property is needed to set for its navigation.

        :cursorMode := HBQTBRW_CURSOR_ROW [Default: HBQTBRW_CURSOR_COLUMN ]

       widget. Resize the window and experience how scrolling is working.
       This way we can present much larger forms then a typical Clipper
       screen could offer.

    + Implemented: "@E" and "@Snn" PICTURE functions.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: ROW/COL properties of GETs.

    + Implemented: @ <nRow>, <nCol> QSAY <exp> PICTURE <pic> COLOR <clr>.
       COLOR is not yet implemented, needs discussion.

    + Implemented: Clipper like form creation with @ SAY, @ GET commands
       given a parent window without any layout.

    + Implemented: support of QFont to be applied to SAYs and GETS.
       This automatically sets the size and

    ! Made: Clipper like form the startup display mode. Send "P" as
       parameter to invoke OOP code screen.

    ; NOTE: we are almost near to design a GUI screen with Clipper code.
            QFont supplied to the form is not set on parent window. It is
            applied only to SAYs and GETs. The rows are calculated on the
            basis of QFont:height() and each row is separated by 6 pixels.

    ;       This seems, the whole protocol can be enhanced to a greater
            horizon with a possibility to have multiple forms in one window.

    % Organized the code to honor deep level of Clipper GET System

    + Implemented: real-time validation indication in the form of
       change in background-color of edit instance. The Clipper variable
       is only updated if RETURN or TAB is pressed, just like Clipper.
    + Matured: numeric GET entry protocol. In some ways it is better
       than Clipper's. PICTURE clause is completely supported.

    ; NOTE: with this basic implementation of Harbour GET System is
            complete. Please test with your in-production code, if possible.
            If you find differences, please report. Also it will be
            helpful if you supply some complex PICTURE clauses used
            in your applications to be added to this demo code.

    ; OPINION: seems this class can be entirely ported to C++ as HBQGet.
               Should it remain as PRG class or be shifted to C++ ?

       VALID is broken if value of a numeric GET is invalid and focus
       is placed on another object with mouse-click and then returned
       to numeric GET. I am at a loss to understand the behavior of
       QValidator in this respect as why it receives :Intermediate
       return and then never set it back.

       ;
       TODO: implementation of Picture Teplates.
    + Completed: Date GET implementation. Now it supports Set( _SET_DATEFORMAT ).
    + Implemented: mouse support as default. To switch off the mouse interaction
       call oEdit:mousable := .F. .
    + Implemented: changed background color to somewhat red of any GET if
       if focus is taken away from it by mouse action and the value
       contained in the edit buffer could not been validated with VALID
       clause. This is a visual only part and actual VALID is performed
       only by keyboard navigation.
    + Added one more field "Telephone Number:" which facilitates the
       verification of template part of picture.

    ; Please test extensively and report back if you see any issues with

    + Numeric: right aligned if picture function does not contain "B".
    + ESC: form is closed if ESCAPE is pressed.
    + :inputValidator is called after respecting picture clause.
    ! Picture function "K" is the default behavior except is LOgicals.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: @ <nX>, <nY> QGET <v> PICTURE <pic> COLOR <color> ;
                     WHEN <when> VALID <valid> VALIDATOR <validator>;
                     CAPTION <cap>

                   QREAD

       This implementation demonstrates how Clipper code can be
       re-used in GUI environment. The implementation demonstrate
       both, OOP and COMMAND syntax usages. Execute validator.exe
       with "p" as parameter to invoke COMMAND code.

       Presently suppoted PICTURE strings are "@!" for character
       and "Y" for logicals. Others will come up next.

       COLOR clause supports Cliiper's standard 16 colors. It can be
       passed as "W+/B",   "B",    "W+/BG*", i.e., foreground/background
       pair. Only one color will be applied to text color.

       Data binding is implemented via :dataLink( bBlock ) method.

       For COMMAND syntax, to fetch set/get block, Harbour's
       GET system is used. Hope it can be exploited further.

2012-12-01 02:41 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Updated: to confirm to Clipper Get System with WHEN and VALIDS.
       The code hosts a small class inherited from QLineEdit which
       controls the edit behavior of gets both per navigation and
       input standards. ENTER and UP/DOWN arrows also behave
       per Clipper standards. The implementation completely by-pass
       mouse input, i.e., no edit is selectable with mouse click.
       This was required to implement WHEN and VALID.

       The class is still a work in progress. As I am feeling tired
       and also it is almost morning, I need to sleep. In the meantime
       examine the code and post your views/opinions/suggestions/whatever.
       Also keep in mind to suggest where such classes, which simulate,
       Clipper behavior, should be hosted.

2012-11-30 13:12 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)

    + Added: HBQValidator() sub-class inheriting QValidator().
       This facilitates to simulate Harbour Get System's input behavior,
       primarily in relation to picture clause at the minimum. But it
       is much more then that. A clever use can put you under total
       control what exactly you want the user to input.

       SYNTAX:  oEdit := QLineEdit( oWnd )
                oEdit:setValidator( HBQValidator( {|cText, nPos| DoValidation( cText, nPos ) } ) )

       RETURN VALUE OF VALIDATION BLOCK:
                It is important to understand the rationale of return
                value of code-block supplied as only parameter to
                HBQValidator which controls the behavior of validation.
                This can be one of the following:

                1. NIL     : will be treated as input is valid.
                2. .T.     : will be treated as input is valid.
                3. .F.     : will not allow the current character.
                4. String  : will replace the input string with returned string.
                5. Numeric : will relocate the editing cursor to this position.
                6. Array   : { cModifiedText|NIL, nCursorPos|NIL, lValid|NIL }
                             the elements corresponds to above #4, #5, #1;2;3

  + hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Added: a demonstration appln consuming HBQValidator() with
       3 different constraints with many sub-variants which clearly
       shows the power of this class. You can experiment further and
       can add interesting combinations in this demo.

  ; WORKING:
    1. Now function name holds the key if a function documentation will be
         replaced or added to the .txt file being modified. This means,
         changing the name of the function will add an entry with new name.
         The match is case insensitive, i.e., WvgCheckBox() will be equal to
         WvgCHECKbox().

    2. All the other upper entries are retained as is if some exist, i.e. like
         copyright notices or SVN header.

    3. Has eliminated the keyword $FUNCNAME$ from entire repository and
         is replaced by $NAME$.

  ; USABILITY: it is recommended that now you use HbIDE to build / edit
               Harbour documentation. The tool is ready to go.

       facilitate the visual way to update Harbour documentation per
       Nanforum standards, which at present, is employed in Harbour
       all-over.

    ; WORKING:
      Editing Existing Documentation:

        1. Click on "Load from .txt file" toolbar icon.
        2. If .txt contains many functions then a list will be presented
             to select one.
        3. Make the necessary changes.
        4. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.

      Creating New Documentation:

        1. Click on "Clear Foem" toolbar icon. Necessary only if you worked
             on some other function previously.
        2. Fill in the fields.
        3. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        4. FileSave dialog will be presented to obtain folder where to save.
             FileName will be auto-constructed from type and function name.
             You can keep it as is or change per your liking.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.

      Both ways SVN Id header will be placed on top of the documentation file.

    ; WHAT WE CAN LOOSE IF EXISTING DOCUMENTATION IS EDITED:

        1. Copyright notices posted on top of the file.
        2. $COMPLIANCE$ is converted to $PLATFORMS$ and is only oneliner.
        3. If $COMPLIANCE$ and $PLATFORMS$ both are present then only
             $COMPLIANCE$ is retained.
        4. Leading "*" will not be present
        5. may be more but I have observed above differences
             while experimenting with harbour/doc/en/*.txt files.

    + Added: <Main Menu><Encoding> option.
       It displays the codepages in this notation:
         Harbour Codepage Name : Unique Codepage ID => "RU866 : cp866"

    + Implemented: per source Harbour supported codepage.
       Now you can write sources supporting different code pages for
       strings inside source text. Each edit instance can have its own
       codepage which can be selected from <Encoding> main-menu option.
       HbIDE remembers codepage associated with a source. When selecting
       a codepage from <Encoding> option, you will be prompted to set
       it as "default". The <Default> codepage will be applied to any
       new source brought to HbIDE for editing.

    ; IMPORTANT : Please read
       1. Setup this current commit or release.
       2. DO NOT execute HbIDE.
       3. Open hbide.ini you are supplying to execute HbIDE.
       4. Change: CurrentCodec=_HarbourCodePageName_ =>
                  CurrentCodec=EN
       5. Execute HbIDE.
       6. Notice the statusbar of HbIDE where codepage entry should be
            visible as "Enc: EN | EN".
       7. First part denotes codepage of this source, second part
            default codepage.
       8. If you need to change the codepage of a source, make sure that
            it has not been modified before the change, initiate change
            from <Encoding> option, close HbIDE, do not save the source
            when prompted, run HbIDE again. This action can be taken for
            multiple source instances. Just REMEMBER that you have not
            to save the source after changing the codepage.

    ; THANKS : Special thanks to Grzegorz and Maurizio for helping me
               understand what is happening under the hood.

      Please make extensive tests. Regression is possible.

  + Applied patch by Francesco Perillo (as explained below), thank you.

  * qtcontribs.hbp
    ! all not-essential Qt modules are remmed by default.
      You need to remove the remark if you want them to be compiled.
      Too much problems reported for aborted builds. In the future we may
      add checks and skip modules missing include files, for the moment it
      will be programmers responsability to un-rem them
    + added -hbcontainer so that the error line about nm is not shown

  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    ! added instpath to current harbour BIN path. This means that hbide
      will be copied in the same directory where harbour executable is !
      This will work both for simple "make" and for "make install"
    ! modified output dir that is anyway replaced by instpath directive

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbp
    + added $hb_pkg_install.hbm
    ! changed path for lib creation

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker
      can find the files created in the path set in hbxbp.hbp file

  * hbqt/hbqt_common.hbm
    ! changed lib target directory
    + copied $hb_pkg_install.hbm content and modified to fit hbQt build method.
      the standard hbm file uses lib name to create a subdir where to store its
      files during install. This is ok for simple libraries like hbxbp,
      where only one lib is created, while it is a problem for hbQT where several
      libraries are created... otherwise we would get addons/hbqtcore addons/hbqtgui.
      no way....  So the changes was just to set hbqt as target directory,
      all the rest unmodified...

  * hbqt/hbqt.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker
      can find the files created in the path set in hbqt_common.hbm file

  * hbxbp/filedialog.prg

        static function instead of old-fashioned dialog.

    + Readded: the header containing latest revision number.
       This is done because otherwise HbIDE cannot be built by a
       user who has not properly set QtContribs build environment,
       which, along other things, require subversion client installed
       on his machine. Mostly it will never be required for average user
       but just in case...

       NOTE: this will always publish one revision less than the current
             in HbIDE title-bar.

       Thanks Przemek for introducing duplicate case constants compile
       time check which could detect these type of error, something

2012-10-07 15:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: the version guard agaisnt which a class is compiled.
       Earlier every class was guarded against v4.5.
       Now class is guarded against minimum of v4.5 or defined for
       a class in .qth in CLASS section.
         <CLASS>
         ...
         Version = 0x040n00

    % Optimizations.
    + Implemented: concept of manageable tool-box containing almost
       entire set of actions spread across menus and toolbars. This
       tiny toolbox can be called with Ctrl+M and appears right near
       the editing cursor position. The interface to manage this toolbox
       is underway, which beside other things, will facilitate to
       configure it visually as to which icons, at what position:row-col,
       should appear. The goal is to allow users to hide all toolbars from
       applications window and call this toolbox whenever there is a need.
       A work-in-progress. But the toolbox is functional with Ctrl+M.

  * hbide/projectwizard.prg

    + Advanced: "New Project Wizard".

  * hbide/docviewgenerator.ui
    % Refined: the working of slider of tree and view widgets, reported
      on users-list. The tree pane area was unable to be expanded on
      the right and hence functions list contents were not visible
      properly.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    % Optimization leading to proper object destruction on Qt level,
       in certain cases. This optimization has no visible impact, but
       certainly improves memory consumption in applications which
       have high rate of creation/destruction cycles.
